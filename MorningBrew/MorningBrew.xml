  <title>Inflation Is Rising Because the Economy Is Weird</title>

Which brings us to the question raging among economists.  So, many officials are betting that once the economy irons out the wrinkles, price growth will settle down to more typical levels. US consumer prices rose 4.2% in April from a year ago, up from the 2.6% gain in March and more than economists expected. When goodbye hugs make a comeback and the rate of inflation hits its highest level in almost 13 years. “This number was well above what I and outside forecasters expected.”</description>
