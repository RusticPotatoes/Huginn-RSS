  <title>New Study Indicates Crowded Indoor Spaces Are Ripe for Covid Transmission</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3082/restaurant_with_covid_sign.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  These researchers argue that probably won't be necessary, because limiting capacity at indoor venues can meaningfully contain the spread of the virus—when paired with critical precautions like social distancing and wearing masks.   On the other hand, reopening indoor businesses at full capacity = recipe for superspreading. Not only were they less likely to work from home, but also the indoor venues they visited were more crowded.   Quick note on methodology: Using anonymized smartphone data, the researchers tracked the movements of 98 million people in 10 U.S. metros from March to May—the first wave of the virus.</description>

Yesterday morning, Pfizer said its Covid-19 vaccine was over 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials.   Next steps The FDA needs follow-up data to make sure Pfizer's vaccine isn't making participants grow tails.   If it gets it, Pfizer says it can produce 50 million doses by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion in 2021.   We don't know if the vaccine prevents asymptomatic transmission or severe Covid cases that cause hospitalization. And an effective vaccine can't come fast enough. Pfizer's product is harder to move around than an octopus ice sculpture.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/xUNd9ZaY6wdUH2ZiGQ/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biden’s said he can’t end the pandemic by “flipping a switch,” but biz leaders hope a more hands-on approach compared to President Trump’s can lead to a quicker economic recovery.   Here are the six things biz leaders want from Biden. No tax hike: Biden has pledged to raise the corporate tax rate, which businesses no-likey. Boringness: Whereas President Trump’s policies fostered a mostly favorable corporate environment, it came with a lot of baggage." Improve trade relations: During his tenure as president, President Trump launched a trade war with China and got into bitter scuffles with longstanding economic partners like the EU.</description>

  <title>Covid-19's Disruption to Contraceptives is Affecting Women Everywhere</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3053/birth_control.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  In developing economies...   While birth rates did swing back, fewer births in a given year or two still have big consequences for economic growth and public finances."    WHO Marking the 60th anniversary of the pill's FDA approval, 2020 could have been a year to celebrate economic gains women made thanks to family planning.   I'm talking about birth control. And the economic consequences of that disruption are not felt evenly. But the pandemic has underscored just how fragile access to birth control remains for millions.   Birth busts have followed health and economic scares before, including the Great Recession, the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, and the 1918 Spanish flu.   Family planning doesn't just save lives, it saves money. But less access to family planning generally means more harmful health outcomes for mothers and kids. And they're already playing out: Contraceptive access fell by almost half in parts of West Africa compared to 2019, according to the International Planned Parenthood Federation." While you could hack workarounds for those, another item in short supply just doesn't work like that.</description>

  <title>Biden on Track to Be Elected President: What It Means for the Biz World</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3049/democratic_presidential_c.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biden’s would be a very different administration The nuts and bolts of Biden’s legislating will depend on how negotiations with Congress play out, but the outline of Biden’s economic platform has three key pillars:  The wealthy will pay more.   While Biden’s Democratic Party is also on track to maintain its majority in the House of Representatives, it looks like the Senate could remain in Republican control—we’ll know more in January after two runoff Senate races in Georgia. The top 0.1% of earners would pay 43% in income taxes under Biden’s plan, per the Penn Wharton Budget Model.</description>

  <title>Fed Leaves Monetary Policy Unchanged Amid Election</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3041/jerome_powell.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;.   Reminder: The Fed handles monetary policy, manipulating the money supply to shape macroeconomic conditions like inflation and employment.   Big picture: For investors, the Fed chair can be just as (if not more) important than who sits in the Oval Office.    This election has personal implications for Powell While the Fed's Board of Governors has two open seats that require Senate confirmation to fill, they've been empty for years, and the bigger question is who takes over as chair when Powell's term ends February 2022. Even after this election ends in 2135, Powell may not be going anywhere. Mr. Jerome Powell.</description>
