  <title>Extra Unemployment Benefits Kept Some Workers on the Sidelines but Did Not Reduce Overall Employment, Report Says</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F867%2Fusa.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Economists are scrambling to figure it out, and yesterday we got a preliminary answer that’s just as nuanced as the question: Extra unemployment insurance (UI) didn’t impact overall job growth, but it did cause a reshuffling of the type of people who were working. The takeawaysIn states that ended extra UI early, hiring for adult workers 25 or older increased the week governors said they were cutting benefits, but returned to typical levels once the benefits actually expired.

Finding the right host is one of the most crucial decisions facing television execs today. But viewership is down 10% in the post-Trebek world.</description>

Vaccine mandates came in fast and furious yesterday as New York City, California, and the Department of Veterans Affairs introduced a choice for employees: join the Mod(erna) Squad or get a weekly Covid test.

  <title>Robinhood's Roadshow Previews an IPO Unlike Any Other</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2127%2Frobinhood_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robinhood execs gave a livestreamed presentation to the public Saturday, ahead of the company’s much-anticipated IPO later this week. Robinhood will price its IPO on Wednesday night and start trading on Thursday. That will allow individual traders to buy stock in the company alongside professionals, and perhaps get ahead of any first-day “pop” in the stock price.   Here’s why:When professional investors buy shares in an IPO, they tend to hold them for a long time.  Companies have historically reserved only 1%–2% of shares for customers, because what Robinhood is doing is risky.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: Getting the Right Mix</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ixZmwZC0R1Zi87EOqG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much money should I be investing and saving in cash every month? Keep enough cash to cover three to six months of expenses in a savings account that you can tap in the face of financial hardship. But cash comes first. Perhaps only Elon Musk appears in this newsletter as much as inflation, which is just one reason not to hoard more cash than is necessary.</description>

  <title>Payroll to the People</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5903%2Fpaycom.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paycom has created Beti, which can further streamline the payroll process by empowering employees to do their own payroll.  And not to get all “ACT NOW” on you, but if you’re waiting until employees ask for employee-driven payroll, it’s already too late. So why keep doing payroll the less-efficient way? Free of FrustrationBy giving employees the tools they need to take control of their payroll processes, you give them the power to prevent frustrating or time-consuming follow-ups if their paycheck is wrong. But now, the thought of a company or brand not having an app seems even more foreign.</description>

Wear what you want. What do I know about running a company? Is there an item of clothing or accessory that you think everyone should have in their closet? I don't think in my entire career there's ever been a time where I was afraid to be vulnerable with my own struggles. But what I really think is that you can wear what you want and get what you want if you understand how style can help you control the narrative of yourself. we just want to talk).  But we've stopped looking for expertise, and we are looking for shared experience. I am. Are you a breakfast person? Both of them have sweet matcha that's not too sweet.</description>

  <title>The Olympics May Have Been Rescheduled, But The 2020 Logo Doesn’t Know That</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5899%2Fpeople_wearing_masks.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the fact that it is very much the year 2021, all Olympic marketing materials, from the TV ads to the gold medals, are stamped with the “Tokyo 2020” logo. One can only imagine the underground market that would have erupted for “Tokyo 2020” merch. Like your old high school friend who constantly brings up his state football championship, the Tokyo Olympics are living in the past. A decision to keep the original branding was made last March, when Japan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Summer games for the first time in history.  The real reason Tokyo 2020 didn’t become Tokyo 2021 is because a change would have been supremely expensive.</description>

  <title>California Sues Gaming Company Activision Blizzard</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5879%2Factivision.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;California legislators sued video game developer Activision Blizzard yesterday, citing its “pervasive ‘frat boy’ culture” and mistreatment of women employees. The suit details that one female employee died by suicide on a corporate trip after nude photos were leaked and shared among male colleagues who had previously harassed her. Bottom line: The lawsuit against Activision Blizzard shows that the #MeToo movement is still reaching its crescendo in the video game industry.  Ubisoft (Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry) was accused of rampant sexism and racism last summer. Denial on all fronts. Activision’s response?</description>
