  <title>Facebook Bans Trump For Six More Months</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4980%2Fthumbs_down_facebook.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facebook handed the Oversight Board the Draw 25 card that is deciding Trump’s ban, and the Oversight Board slapped down a Reverse: It has tasked Facebook with clearing up its convoluted rules around handling prominent users like Trump. The reason social media platforms can go the latter route without fear of being sued by disgruntled users boils down to a piece of legislation: Section 230, which is looking a little weathered 25 years after being introduced. Co-chairman Michael McConnell said Facebook must restore Trump’s account, ban him permanently, or put a time limit on his suspension.</description>

During the pandemic, Tiger went on a dealmaking run for the ages that’s culminating in a new $10 billion fund, the largest ever raised by an independent fund manager for minority tech investments. But whereas SoftBank went deep in a few moonshot startups, Tiger is going wide, throwing money at founders before other investors swoop in. What is Tiger? It owned ~10% of Coinbase before its public debut.</description>

  <title>How to Write a Cover Letter and Not Hate the Process</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9O9elEvuRjMyXu/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cover letter is often the first time a hiring manager gets the chance to “meet” you, so don’t waste it. Always thank people for their time and, while this might be controversial, “best” is the best way to sign off (besides “love,” but unfortunately that’s not appropriate for a job application. Identify the company’s mission, look at the way it talks about itself, and reference it in your cover letter. = I know how to write for a specific audience(I’m a fan of hyperlinking in cover letters and resumes. I can offer a unique perspective coming from the legal sphere, for example, I can help Morning Brew never get sued. Here’s a copy of my cover letter for Morning Brew:“My name is Mattison Merritt and I’m a writer, comedian, and social media manager currently living in Chicago. = I’m good at time managementProve that you did your research“I want to join the Morning Brew team as a writer to help make business news more accessible and engaging.” Maybe humor isn’t the way to go, but adding a little personality to your cover letter can make you stand out. Be funny sometimes, be interesting alwaysI had four clever bits in my cover letter and each of them helped illustrate, but not distract from, the point I was trying to make about myself or my experience. Here are a few lines from my cover letter where I hit the job qualifications without just listing a bunch of buzzwords:“I’ve worked at the American Bar Association for two years now, within the first year I was promoted twice in part because I wanted to create projects that would allow me to research legal topics I was interested in.” So here’s a rundown of how I used my cover letter to land the best job I’ve ever had—besides being a camp counselor, of course.  Here’s one example: “I can offer a unique perspective coming from the legal sphere, for example, I can help Morning Brew never get sued.</description>

  <title>C-corp vs. Pass-through Taxes: What’s the Difference?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For tax purposes, businesses are either pass-through entities or C corporations. You’re taxed on your entire share of business profits, regardless of whether they sit in your business or personal bank account. If you’re paying attention, you might have caught that dividends are taxed twice: once at the entity level and again on our personal tax returns. Business profits are passed through to owners, who pay taxes based on individual tax rates. I’ll owe tax on $40,000, and you’ll owe tax on the remaining $60,000. One of them is how you want your business to be taxed.  Multiple business structures are subject to pass-through taxation. Pass-through entities are businesses that pay income taxes solely on their owners’ individual tax returns. In general, solo entrepreneurs and small businesses opt for pass-through taxation since there’s less paperwork and red tape, while medium and large companies often favor C-corp tax treatment. It’s called a pass-through because the business doesn’t pay an entity-level income tax. And, you can change your business structure or tax status as your business’s needs evolve. On my tax return, I report my $40,000 salary and my share of the dividend, which is $2,000. Let’s see how that works if our phone case business is a C-corp. What is C-corp taxation?  Notice how our tax liabilities don’t take into account how much money we moved from business coffers into our personal bank accounts? C-corps report income and pay taxes on Form 1120.</description>

  <title>Upfront About Newfronts: A Q&amp;A with Tubi Chief Content Officer, Adam Lewinson</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4949%2Ftubi_newfronts.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We just announced that we’ll be launching Tubi Originals with more than 140 hours of content designed specifically with Tubi viewers in mind. As you look at the content and streaming landscape, where do you think the next great innovation will be?  I think not only for 2021, but for next year as well, streaming is poised to take center stage at Upfronts. While we of course highlight the premium content that brings in our viewers and keeps them engaged, we also discuss ways in which Tubi can help maximize a brand’s ability to measure and manage ads—including our Advanced Frequency Management tool which reduces ad repetition, our Certified Measurement Program which helps brands better measure the effectiveness of their advertising spend, and our Content Intelligence which gives brands insights to better inform their campaign creative and targeting. With the largest library of any streaming service—over 30,000 titles and growing—we have a robust collection of movies and TV shows across every genre.   When you think about places where you can innovate better than your peers, what comes to mind?  It’s Upfronts season, and everyone is jockeying for attention. That said, consumers are only willing to pay for so many subscription streaming services, especially as new players have entered the market, so AVOD will likely become a much larger focus of the conversation in the next few years. Two different areas come to mind to me—the first is our ad tech.</description>

With a net worth of about $145 billion, Bill Gates is the fourth-richest person in the world. In a joint statement, Bill and Melinda said they will "continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives." Zoom out: Bill and Melinda are the second Seattle-area power couple to get divorced in recent years. More questions than answers.</description>
