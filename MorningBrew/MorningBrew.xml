  <title>Morning Brew Readers Share Their Quarantine Dating Stories</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/x28cIQSn19Tbi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some made us laugh, some made us cry, and others made us go, “Hmm, didn’t know masks could be used for that.” And because we just met, neither one of us wanted to end the date because we had to pee. To spice things up I said my favorite drink was Mountain Dew... “Did a virtual date for the first time. The call ended about 5 minutes later when I told her I can't date a liar.” she didn't bat an eye and proceeded to tell me she doesn't really drink soda. For more pandemic dating stories, check out the Social Distance Project.</description>

  <title>Morning Brew/Harris Poll Finds Americans Split in Pandemic Dating Attitudes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3471/masked_man_with_flowers.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  So what does a pandemic date look like?   Bottom line: “The dating game in COVID is all screen and no scene,” said Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema. Fifty-nine percent of respondents say they will be dating less once the pandemic is over, but 41% say they will date more. “While 40% are using dating apps more, 44% have anxiety over lost time dating in real life.   We’re similarly polarized on the topic of dating FOMO.</description>

  <title>Bitcoin Is All Grown Up</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Vi5qBEpExoCmzEcDvF/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Accumulation is the name of the game Around 62% of bitcoin in circulation hasn’t changed hands in over a year, a sign that fewer people are actively trading bitcoin, and more are holding onto it (HODL, if you will).    Inexperienced investors getting burned by altcoins (aka cryptocurrencies that aren’t bitcoin) is a familiar story. That’s because bitcoin isn’t being used as an intermediary to move capital into other “shitcoins.”       Searches for keyword "Bitcoin" via Google Trends Zoom out: A look at Google search data indicates interest by individual investors is far lower than  it was in 2017.   Investors have wisened up on altcoins Rewind to 2017. And publicly traded companies like Square and MicroStrategy have moved portions of their cash reserves into bitcoin.   Startups like Ryze and Swan help users accumulate bitcoin at regular intervals regardless of price, a classic investing strategy known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA).   Institutional investors have entered the chat In 2017, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called bitcoin a fraud and a bubble: “It’s worse than tulip bulbs.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3179/housing_market.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Compared to 2019, mortgage applications are up 26% and refinances 105%, per the Mortgage Bankers Association.

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lptjRBxFKCJmFoibP3/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury labeled the European country and Vietnam currency manipulators.   Why it matters: Labeling countries as currency manipulators is rarer than a Federer two-handed backhand, and it reflects the tougher trade stance taken by the Trump administration toward both allies and rivals.   What is currency manipulation?</description>

  <title>Brew’s Bookshelf: Holiday Gift Guide</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3447/holiday_books.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Henry Stockwell, copywriter: E: A Novel by Matt Beaumont This novel is really just a collection of fake emails from a fictional London ad agency at the start of the 21st century, when I guess ad agencies still operated somewhat like Mad Men?   Milo Booke, product manager: One Billion Americans by Matthew Yglesias  Yglesias lays out a vision of an America that reorients its policies and culture toward growing our population massively, giving us more economic and diplomatic heft and influence in a world of other ascendant global powers.   Mainly, this book takes anime seriously as a “media success story,” just as companies like Netflix are starting to do.   Eliza Carter, daily newsletter writer: Billion Dollar Loser by Reeves Wiedeman  You know the rise and fall of WeWork was nuts. If you’re a movie buff, this is a must read. Hayden Field, Emerging Tech Brew writer: Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener  A beautifully-written memoir about the author’s move from the New York publishing industry to the Silicon Valley tech world. This is the main question asked throughout the book and I believe that it guides the reader to find that answer. Buy it here. How much of it is what we really know and want versus what’s taught to us?   Kate Noel, VP &amp; head of people ops: Untamed by Glennon Doyle  A memoir that really peels back the layers of what it means to be a woman, mother, and friend in today’s society. But this up-close account from NYMag reporter Reeves Wiedeman reveals the nuttery to be even nuttier than you imagined.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett, David Solomon Urge Congress to Extend PPP for Small Businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3431/warren_buffett.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  PPP has been criticized for fraud and not actually going to small businesses. It's a $525 billion government program intended to help small businesses keep workers on payroll. In an interview with CNBC yesterday morning, legendary investor Warren Buffett urged Congress to pass legislation to help small businesses stay afloat. Help could be on the way if Congress gets the job done.   A real-world example: This summer, American Airlines was able to raise $2.5 billion from selling bonds even as it was bleeding $58 million/day.</description>

  <title>Christmas Markets Need a Christmas Miracle</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3429/santa_claus.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The situation is even tougher for vendors at San Francisco's Dickens Fair, which is a historic market that requires vendors to meet certain standards of "authenticity." His experience implementing health and safety protocols at the flea market helped him open the holiday market in-person safely. Michael Berman, who created the market 16 years ago, also runs D.C.'s Eastern Market and had to adapt this spring to pandemic-era guidelines. While the Christkindlmarket in Chicago is showcasing about 50 exhibitors online (close to the number it welcomed at its in-person market), most are "hanging on for dear life," according to Kate Bleeker, director of expansion and market development.   Vendors need help Small businesses that sell at markets often depend on a handful of in-person events for the majority of their annual sales. In San Francisco, the Great Dickens Christmas Fair also canceled its in-person market and set up the Dickens Fair at Home with an online shop and virtual experiences.   At Bryant Park, foot traffic and sales are estimated at a third of previous years’ levels, and Vagianos said vendors are worried."    But this year, the markets in D.C., San Francisco, and NYC currently have anywhere from a third to half the typical number of vendors exhibiting.   After watching in-person events get postponed the start of the pandemic and reconstitute on Zoom over the summer, Christmas markets began having tough conversations—and we're not talking about the final design for the collectible 2020 candle holder.   Other markets decided to open...</description>
