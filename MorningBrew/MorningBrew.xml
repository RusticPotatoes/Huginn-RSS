  <title>The SEC Threatens to Sue Coinbase</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7330%2Fcoinbase_court_case.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Coinbase says Lend doesn’t involve securities and called that assumption “strange.” In this case, the SEC says they’ll sue Coinbase if and when it launches Lend. Lend would let Coinbase users earn interest by lending digital assets—specifically, a stablecoin called USD Coin—to others. That’s how Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong described the SEC’s latest crypto crackdown. According to Coinbase, the Wall Street regulator has sent the leading crypto exchange a “Wells notice” regarding its upcoming lending product, Lend.</description>

  <title>Examining the Pop Culture Legacy of the September 11 Attacks</title>

Leading up to the anniversary of the September 11 attacks this Saturday, we’ll feature stories that explore the economic impact of 9/11, 20 years later. How long will it be before a director pitches a pandemic film?</description>

  <title>Your employees' mental health care starts with your own</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/mHwiw1aa0ztS6clQGy/giphy.gif?cid=790b761173866b309d7508c4d9912daf31a6174c564adcbd&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Take time off,” Hartless said.  With burnout on the rise, Hartless said it’s essential that companies give workers the ability to create boundaries. Make room beyond Zoom According to July’s Mental Health Index: US Worker Edition, which synthesized random survey results of 500 workers, the risk of generalized anxiety among US workers has risen 94% since July and 98% since the beginning of the pandemic. To combat that sense of unrelenting work, she said it’s important to let workers know that they can switch their cameras off during video calls, and take time off to tend to their own mental health. At Mitel, the company created a “Wellness Village,” crammed with employee resources, such as webinars where workers can vent about their struggles during the pandemic.  Hartless said her company has implored its leaders to “open the door” by addressing mental health; in one example, she recalled an executive who talked about his long battle with mental health for a group of employees. HR’s function as an emotional sounding board for employees has only intensified during the pandemic, despite the fact that HR professionals are also suffering.</description>

  <title>El Salvador’s Grand Bitcoin Experiment</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7300%2Fel_salvador-economy-crypt.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to El Salvador, where the pupusas are warm and the bitcoin is tender. Bukele also thinks that, by being an early adopter, the country could become a destination for foreign investment in bitcoin mining.  One-quarter of El Salvador’s GDP comes from remittances—money sent back to the country from people working abroad. Today, the Central American nation will become the first sovereign state to make bitcoin “legal tender,” meaning it’s now an official currency alongside the US dollar.</description>

  <title>Longer Waits, Safer Planes: How 9/11 Changed Air Travel</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7298%2Ftsa_security_lines_at_den.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After hijackers commandeered four planes the morning of September 11, 2001, the US revamped its process for airport security screening to prevent similar attacks. Airlines struggled to recover: Airline revenue for domestic US flights fell by $10 billion/year from 2001–2006. Only in November 2001 did the government create the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to handle security at airports.</description>

When Americans were all winding down from their second Saturday, Weibo—China’s version of Twitter—suspended at least 21 fan accounts for K-pop bands like BTS and Blackpink. – MM</description>

  <title>Study Shows Automated Résumé Scanner Mistakenly Rejects Millions of Viable Job Candidates</title>

Before September 11, 2001, the US had been cutting military spending. Military spending doubled to $700 billion in the decade following 9/11, to about 20% of total government spending.   Did you know?</description>

  <title>US Winds Down Massive, Controversial Unemployment Benefits Program</title>

Around the same time, the government also expanded the number of workers eligible for unemployment insurance (UI) by including people like gig workers and the self-employed.</description>
