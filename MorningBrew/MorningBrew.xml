  <title>SpaceX’s Starlink Internet Service Has 69,420 Users</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/fr0a9Np0PlcJTVevU5/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;69,420, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said yesterday. Starlink provides internet via a network of over 1,500 satellites orbiting low enough for stargazers to spot them overhead. He said Starlink could make up to $30 billion in revenue per year—about 10 times the revenue of the rocket-launching side of SpaceX.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/jqU6OtxNhty3DuMz6h/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Bulletin is Facebook’s latest product that chases individual creators; its previous launch was a Clubhouse competitor for live audio content, which Zuck used to announce Bulletin.

  <title>United Makes Big Bet on the Future of Air Travel</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5595%2Fcatalogue_of_plane.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, we actually mean actual business travel “Everything we see every week makes us even more certain that business travel and international travel are ultimately going to come back,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. Fast forward to yesterday, and United Airlines just placed its largest plane order ever and the biggest of any airline in a decade. One does not simply order 270 state-of-the-art planes worth more than $30 billion and then leave them unopened in the hangar.</description>

  <title>US Home Price Growth Hits a Record High in April</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4744%2Flumber_prices.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Actually, experts say the housing market won’t implode like it did 10 years ago. Home prices in cities like Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle are all up more than 20% year over year. You might be better off getting creative, like these folks: A Bethesda, MD, homebuyer pledged to name her first-born child after the seller in a written offer.</description>

The first US company to hit a $1 trillion valuation was Apple in 2018, and since then Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all joined.</description>

  <title>Juul Agrees to Pay $40 million to Settle North Carolina Vaping Case</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5592%2Fjuul.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Altria, the tobacco giant that owns Marlboro, bought a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, Juul was valued at $38 billion. The same year, the FDA called teen vaping an “epidemic” and started to crack down on Juul and other e-cig companies. Although Juul insisted that its products were intended for adults, its marketing strategies said otherwise... as of last summer, Juul was facing 758 lawsuits across the US. Juul released fruit-flavored pods that went viral among teens (it's pulled most flavors since). That verdict is expected by September.</description>

The same year, the FDA called teen vaping an “epidemic” and started to crack down on Juul and other e-cig companies. When Altria, the tobacco giant that owns Marlboro, bought a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, Juul was valued at $38 billion. The value of Juul plummeted to $4.5 billion. Juul invented fruit flavored e-cigarette pods that went viral among teens. as of July 22, 2020, Juul was facing 758 lawsuits across the US.</description>

  <title>Extra Unemployment Benefits Are Drying Up </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5571%2Fus-unemployment-job.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Businesses are desperate to hire workers, and many states think scrapping the extra $300/week in unemployment benefits, which the Biden administration incorporated into its pandemic relief bill, will spur more job-seeking.  In the states that cut off the extra payments the earliest, the number of workers who were paid benefits decreased 13.8% from mid-May to mid-June. On Capitol Hill last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that extra benefits could be playing a role in the worker shortage problem, but focused his attention on other challenges holding back the job market.</description>

  <title>Extra Unemployment Benefits Are Drying Up </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5571%2Fus-unemployment-job.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In the states that cut off the extra payments the earliest, the number of workers who were paid benefits decreased 13.8% from mid-May to the week ending June 12. Businesses are desperate to hire workers, and many states think scrapping the extra $300/week in unemployment benefits, which the Biden administration incorporated into its pandemic relief bill, will spur more job-seeking. Ten more states including Florida, Ohio, and Texas ended extra unemployment benefits on Saturday. Earlier this month, the job site Indeed found that job search activity fell below the national trend in states that cut off extra benefits in June.</description>

  <title>F1 Is Having a Moment in the United States</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5558%2Ff1_winter_testing_in_barc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Last week, Formula 1 re-upped its partnership with the sports merchandise retailer Fanatics after sales on the online F1 store popped 40% globally in 2020. F101: A Formula 1 season typically consists of 20+-races in glamorous locations like Monaco, Abu Dhabi, and Portugal. It's got that kind of power," he told The Drive about the new F1 race. F1 has added a race there for the 2022 season, which—along with Austin—makes for two races held in the US on the same calendar. And I think it's going to be something that redefines who we are. The Brew's Formula 1 Slack channel is the fastest-growing micro-community at the company.  But Formula 1 has been around since 1950. I think this is one of those macro events, like Art Basel. They actually change the city.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with… Chef José Andrés</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5560%2Fjose_andres.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the people of India coming together to heal and feed the people of India—it's really amazing. Can you tell us about your experience there? Back home, do you see #ChefsforAmerica winding down as we move out of the pandemic, or continuing in some other form? You and WCK recently spent some time in India serving meals to frontline workers. There are six days left to donate to Morning Brew's fundraiser for World Central Kitchen and secure a copy of our digital cookbook, Brunch with the Brew. You'll just have to follow me on TikTok for the best ones…maybe you can start with making cocktails in the snow. There are so many! You only get to eat one condiment for the rest of your life. They don't need to go stand in line for hours, and instead can pick up a meal from a restaurant or get it delivered, which hopefully makes it a little easier for families to get through the day.</description>
