  <title>This Year’s All-Star Game Gets More Political</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5751%2Fall-star_game_in_denver.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backstory: In April, the MLB said it was moving the All-Star Game from Georgia to Denver due to Georgia’s new voting law. Either way, Denver businesses are happy to play host. Zoom out: A tourism board in Georgia said losing the game cost Georgia $100+ million in economic activity, though MLB estimates are slightly lower.</description>

  <title>Global Tax Reform Update</title>

  <title>Branson in Space: Risky or Reckless?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F662%2Frichard_branson.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His personal ambitions are intertwined with the company’s—this space flight was inevitable.    Micron shares fell more than 6% following the news of Appleton’s death. A 2011 study found that CEOs with licenses to pilot small aircraft (an activity 30x more dangerous than driving a car) are 40% more likely to make a corporate acquisition and 15% more likely to take on greater leverage. The company has completed more than 20 test flights, but the mission has been delayed by technical issues and a pilot died in a test flight in 2014. Bottom line: When Richard Branson decided to create a space company, it’s probably because he wanted to go to space.</description>

  <title>China Tightens Regulations On Its Tech Companies</title>

Hong Kong could soon become the only place for non-Chinese investors to buy stakes in Chinese tech companies as regulators throttle firms listed in the US. When Didi decided to go public anyway last week, the government halted new app downloads and user signups in China.</description>
