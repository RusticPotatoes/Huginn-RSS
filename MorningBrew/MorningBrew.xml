  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKQO1dMAnxRXlPW/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   But ordinary times these are not.   One benefit of an online holiday party?   You’ll find everything you need right here. What is Slack’s video function but an opportunity for embarrassment waiting to happen? We aren’t so sure. “At corporate holiday parties, you typically get a handful of folks who end up drinking too much and do something embarrassing,” Ryan Costello of Event Farm told the WSJ.</description>

  <title>FDA Approves Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine, Raising Questions Over Who Counts as Essential</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3380/covid_shot_line.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Now comes the hard part  Pfizer, BioNTech, and other manufacturers have generated lifesaving products at a breathtaking speed...   Bottom line: It will ultimately fall to the states to decide which workers are “essential” enough to receive the first, limited doses of the vaccine. Currently, the only clear directive is that healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities go first—and no industry reps dispute that.   Unblinding would hamstring the research process... but it would also get people vaccinated.</description>

  <title>ETFs: Everything You Need To Know, And Then Some</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3370/motley_fool_etf.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One More ETF FYI As a beginner investment vehicle, ETFs can be a wonderful way to get a hang of the market and all of its fluctuations. If your brokerage charges you fees when you buy or sell ETF shares, its cost effectiveness can go out the window.   ETFs can track indexes from bonds to the NASDAQ, so find one that represents your own risk-tolerance and long-term plan.   An under-the-radar stock that could overperform. You can find out what the management team tracks their performance to, which is a good indicator to determine if you want that for your own portfolio. So good luck, and ETFs FTW. ETFs are not Always Cheaper It’s true, ETFs can be more cost-effective for the average investor than other funds.   In case you forgot, ETFs—or Exchange-Traded Funds—are funds that are traded on public exchanges just like a stock. If you read our Ultimate Guide to Investing, created with our friends at The Motley Fool, you’ll remember our comparison of ETFs to succulents.</description>

  <title>DoorDash IPO Could Value It at $36B</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3356/doordash_going_public.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today, DoorDash says it has 58% of the suburban market.   The pandemic solidified DoorDash's lead in the U.S. food delivery industry, catapulting its market share to nearly 50% (No. 2 Uber Eats has 28%). Q2 revenue jumped 214% annually, propelling DoorDash to the first profitable quarter for a food delivery company. DoorDash reportedly priced its shares at $102 a pop, which, on a fully diluted basis, would equate to about a $39 billion market cap.     Why the hype? As food delivery companies went wheel-to-wheel in cities, DoorDash opted for a market with less competition: the 'burbs.</description>

Q2 revenue jumped 214% annually, propelling DoorDash to the first profitable quarter for a food delivery company. And with DoorDash commissions climbing as high as 30%, restaurants may look for cheaper options.     Why the hype? Raising $3+ billion should help. Monthly subscribers have more than tripled to 5 million, and 390,000+ merchants use its app. Is the balance sheet keeping up?</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Grammar Blog, No. 6: Rules Are Rules, Except When They’re Not</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/130JryJRLP4cN2/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;People sometimes think a run-on sentence is one that has...     Gets the job done, but now it’s not entirely clear which piece of information the reader should be focused on.    Long sentences can be run-ons, but it’s not their length that makes them so.   Unhelpful Rule No. 1: Run-on sentences = writer jail Run-ons are definitely to be avoided, but it’s important to remember the actual definition of a run-on.   Way better.   News Cycle Case Study  In this section, I focus on a recent news story and explain why it’s tricky for people to write about.   Active voice: JPMorgan underwrote the listing.   That’s all I have for this edition.   Passive voice: The listing was underwritten by JPMorgan.   In this case, the passive voice is fine because the actors who elected Reagan (i.e., U.S. voters) aren’t important to the sentence; the year is the focus. But in some instances, we don’t need to avoid the passive voice like it’s an indoor gathering—because it’s not actually important who’s doing the acting.   Unhelpful Rule No. 2: Passive voice = writer jail  What’s the passive voice?   Bottom line: Correct sentences are correct sentences; length is irrelevant. Grammar “rules” are really more like guidelines that come with asterisks and exceptions and unlesses. This is a series about grammar and style.</description>

  <title>Ikea to Stop Making Iconic Catalog After this Year</title>

  <title>China Trade Surplus Reaches Highest Level Ever</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2420/u_s_-china_trade_war.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;S-China trade deficit is closely watched because one of President Trump's main economic goals was to reduce the imbalance by slapping tariffs on Chinese goods. In November, China posted its biggest month for exports on record, and its trade surplus—the amount by which exports exceed imports—topped $75 billion.</description>

  <title>California Water Futures are First to Trade on Chicago Mercantile Exchange</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3349/water_futures.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  If you buy a futures contract, you agree to purchase the asset at a predetermined price on a future date.   California farmers could use the help California is the country's largest water market by a magnitude of four, but its water supply is less consistent than a container of strawberries in January. Investors can buy futures contracts for everything from fresh bacon to Burgundy wine, but the commoditization of an element critical to daily life is worrying to some observers—especially as water access becomes more strained." California's spot water market is worth ~$1.1 billion.</description>

  <title>Q3 2020 Recap</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Jl4M6CA3Id6Op5SXRD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional golf has been underway for months with only minor testing headaches, while the pandemic-era versions of the Tour de France, the U.S. Open in tennis, and the Kentucky Derby went off smoothly. If the first two quarters of the year meant us coming to terms with a global pandemic, Q3 saw us settling into a ~new normal~ of face masks, parking lot dining, and saying "whoops, sorry!"   So what about K-12?   Q3 was the busiest for public offerings since the dot-com era.   That was a lot.   The election, for one.   Over the last three months, extreme weather events made more intense and frequent by human-induced climate change have ravaged communities across the country. There's actually good news.   Pulse check on the economic recovery  It's...   So why are biz leaders wearing out DocuSign?   Looking ahead On the monetary side...   On the corporate side...   On the fiscal side...   Looking ahead... School Reopenings Test Students, College Towns, and Parents After schools across the country closed their doors in the spring, John Krasinski hosted virtual prom, graduation ceremonies were streamed online, and at least one student accidentally said, “Sup, b****?”   Soccer: A  This summer, the National Women's Soccer League became the first major U.S. sports league to return to action from the Covid break, while the MLS has already welcomed fans back in certain states.    How the Economic Recovery Fared in Q3 As the ink dries on Q3, nearly 900,000 Americans are filing new jobless claims each week.   The Atlantic Coast produced so many big tropical storms that the World Meteorological Organization depleted its list of 21 names by September and is now using the Greek alphabet. Even where students can attend school, many parents have chosen not to enroll them. University of Iowa students angered Twitter (an easy feat, really) by lining up for downtown bars in Iowa City, which earlier this month had the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases per capita in the U.S. But for local businesses like The Airliner bar, students returning to campus is their only lifeline—revenue was $0 in April.   Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Parts of the West Coast have been ablaze since August, with a record 3.7 million acres burned across California. Climate change is no longer one of those problems. the M&amp;A could keep flowing, but experts think the IPO frenzy will settle by late October.   Whether you want to relive summer 2020 or would rather pretend it never happened, we present: the Brew's third quarter recap. Basketball: A+  Zero NBA players have tested positive for Covid-19 since entering the famous "bubble" in Orlando. The Tampa Bay Rays, the Brew’s July pick to win it all, entered the postseason as the top team in the American League. But with the election and a Supreme Court fight ahead, don't hold your breath for more emergency aid until the Christmas lights come out.</description>
