  <title>Icebreakers with… John Green</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5292%2Fjohn_green.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would love for there to be a Major League Soccer team in Indianapolis, but I would not want to own it. What's something that podcasting offers that books don't and vice versa? Tell us about something you love doing that you're terrible at.

Tom Cotton, were pushing the US government to investigate claims that the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  As researchers studied Covid-19's origins last year, the natural origin theory dominated and the lab leak theory was considered preposterous. this lab leak theory may not be as crazy as it sounds." But as 2020 went on, scientists found no evidence to support the natural origin theory, China was stonewalling any credible independent investigation, and people started saying, "You know what... Lab leak: A scientist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat viruses, was infected with a contagious strain through a sloppy mistake or an accident, and brought it out to the wider world.</description>

How can I buy some time with the company that gave me the offer?"</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/e66SQjvSUuIldz0vtk/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But interestingly enough, after a bunch of testing, Instagram found that user wellbeing and app usage didn’t change when likes were removed.

  <title>Amazon Acquires MGM for $8.5 Billion</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/iOjNaLUI4oBgc/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Amazon will get a leg up at the Emmys too, and not just because MGM houses The Handmaid’s Tale, Fargo, and Vikings, but also because it’s a studio capable of churning out more prestige TV.

The backstory: In December, Engine No. 1, a brand new hedge fund, bought ~$40 million of Exxon shares—just 0.02% of the company—and sent a letter to the board with a simple request: Invest in clean energy, or else. Following a vote at the company’s shareholder meeting yesterday, the activist investment firm Engine No. 1 won at least two of the four board seats it was aiming for.</description>
