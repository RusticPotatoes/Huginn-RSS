  <title>Microsoft to Buy Speech Tech Company Nuance for $16B</title>

The Nuance acquisition could catapult it ahead. er, nuance of human language.</description>

  <title>New York Raises Income Taxes on Super Wealthy, Raising Concerns Among Corporations</title>

The Neuralink device analyzes Pager’s movements and begins to predict them.  Looking ahead...</description>

  <title>Ask HR: Can I Eat During Zoom Meetings?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not for nothing, you could probably get away with keeping your video off during a larger group meeting to eat food. During Covid, I've helped Morning Brew host trivia nights, socially distanced picnics, a virtual drag show, a magic show, and a virtual escape room, just to name a few. But if you feel nervous about eating your sushi on camera, then you might want to wait until after the awkward goodbye waves at the end of your meeting. Do you have any ideas for non-cringe virtual activities?</description>

  <title>The Big Ballot Showdown at the Arctic Circle</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4675%2Fgreenland_ballot.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Greenland pops up in the news, it means one of three things: a) global warming is getting worse, b) someone wants to buy it, or c) a dramatic election was just held over a rare earths mining project with implications for US national security. Expect the battle over Greenland, and within Greenland itself, to heat up in the next few years.  For the US: With China controlling over 70% of rare earth mining, the US is eyeing Greenland’s reserves (about 10% of the world’s rare earths) as a way to become less reliant on China for these critical raw materials. But like _____, there’s so much potential, and that’s what this election was all about. A lot is at stake For Greenland and for the US, China, Russia, or anyone else that considers themselves a global superpower.</description>
