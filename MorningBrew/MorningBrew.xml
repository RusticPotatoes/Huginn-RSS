  <title>Offshore Wind Project In Martha's Vineyard Nears Approval</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4343%2Foffshore_wind_turbines.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It'd be a breakthrough for domestic offshore wind in the US, and the Biden administration hopes this project will kick the industry into high gear.  About two dozen East Coast wind projects are in various stages of development, and several states in the region have promised to purchase at least 25,000 MW of offshore power by 2035.</description>

For context, overall unemployment hit a record 14.8% last April. We had a 3.5% unemployment rate before the pandemic and there was no sign of inflation increasing," she told MSNBC.</description>

  <title>Cathie Wood and Ark Innovation Are Off to a Tough Start in 2021</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4338%2Fsinking_ark.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ark's five exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have all dropped over 20% since early February, and its flagship fund, Ark Innovation, has declined for three weeks in a row. One example: Tesla accounts for around 10% of Ark Innovation. And Ark is particularly sensitive to any moves away from higher-risk tech stocks because it has so much exposure to them.  In 2020, Ark Innovation became the largest actively managed ETF in the world, with $17 billion in assets under management. That position made Wood look like a genius when Tesla gained almost 8x last year, but stocks don't always go up.</description>
