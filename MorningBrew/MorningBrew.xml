  <title>How to Buy Bitcoin...Without Buying Bitcoin</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3997%2Fbitcoin_tesla.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a publicly traded, SEC-reporting company that you can invest in through your normal brokerages, making it more accessible to traders who are less comfortable navigating other avenues for acquiring bitcoin. Invest in companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheetsOn August 11, 2020, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy became the first publicly traded company to allocate a portion of its cash holdings into bitcoin.  Now, many of them are publicly traded companies that you can also invest in. Invest in crypto trading platforms As cryptocurrencies have risen to prominence over the last decade, so too have companies that offer a safe and secure way to buy and sell the digital assets. The cards listed below each give you a small amount of bitcoin every time you swipe. Invest in blockchain ETFsA relatively recent development in the crypto space is the rise of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that offer exposure to bitcoin and other blockchain-based companies. One is made up of bitcoin and the other ethereum, which are the two largest cryptocurrencies. Since then, higher profile companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets, most notably Tesla, leading to more opportunities for investors to get their toes wet without diving all the way into the crypto deep end.</description>

  <title>Let the Pandemic Take Office Dress Codes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/geXJ0CoZr9PyM/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“ Most straight-sized folks can go out to a store and just buy clothing or can go thrift a lot of their professional attire,” they said. Melinda, a new teacher who asked to be identified by only their first name, spent $600+ when they switched schools after their first year of teaching and had to match a new school’s muddy “business professional” dress code. Business casual is a dress code so ill-defined that the best way to describe it is to say what it isn’t. Dress codes create financial barriers for young people, support bias in the workplace, and cause more problems that bleed over into our everyday lives, even after the end of the work day. At one point, I even got a comment from my office manager asking if I had already worn one of those three shirts earlier that week,” he said. Her job is asking employees to come back into the office, and when she tried to bring up her financial concerns about purchasing new office clothes, she was met with congratulations on her weight loss. For the last year-and-a-half, most office workers have been working from home in, at their fanciest, a stain-free shirt for meetings. Dress codes create a barrierThis confusion can be frustrating and expensive for young people entering the workforce.  And for many young professionals, there’s a serious disconnect between dress codes and pay. brands might be seeing the error of their ways. Emily Milligan, a recent grad, told Morning Brew that after getting a competitive unpaid internship with their state’s attorney general, they had to buy an entire suit. The good news: Business casual and its precious lil $50 flowy-sleeved blouses are already on their way out. Before we do, let’s officially retire office dress codes.</description>

The retailer said its stores were busy with parents buying backpacks, lunch boxes, and other school supplies for their kids, and even raised its revenue outlook for the year. With inflation on the rise, consumers should expect to pay 10%–15% more compared to last year for apparel, according to USA Today. Families with children in elementary through high school plan to spend an average of $848.90 on school supplies, a $59 increase over last year. — NF</description>

Hundreds of Afghan civilians clung to the sides of a US military aircraft as it took flight in hopes of fleeing the country following the Taliban takeover.   Since the US ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, Afghan women made gains in the workforce and in education.  One of those signs: Female employees at banks are reportedly being told to stay home and that male relatives could take over their duties.</description>

  <title>Everything you’ve wondered about crypto (but were too embarrassed to ask)</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1671%2Fbull_with_crypto.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  That’s why governments aren’t sure what to do with them... )How much is crypto worth? Think of it like Chuck E.  If you can’t buy much stuff with it, why is so much money parked in it? That’s why a Dockers-wearing, old-school financial adviser might tell you to just not go there... That’s because crypto is virtual, not physical, meaning a token IRL looks like a very long and inscrutable string of numbers and letters. If you want to get involved, just do a lot of reading so you understand what you’re getting into. There are definitely crypto connoisseurs out there—they make themselves known, especially on social media—but this article isn’t for them. Even the name of bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto is widely believed to be a pseudonym. Bitcoin alone is currently valued at more than $875 billion, or about $46,552 per token. In April, the category topped $2 trillion for the first time, and as of this writing it’s hovering around there again. That baffling string refers to a bunch of transactions that took place on the blockchain. Musk is feeling on that particular day.</description>

  <title>Anonymous Chat App Yik Yak Is Back Four Years After Shutting Down</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6270%2Fyik_yak_promo_image.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Yik Yak is the id unleashed. The revived Yik Yak said it’s trying to clean up the toxicity by instituting a one-strike no bullying policy and providing links to mental health resources—though most of the functionality appears similar to V1.</description>

  <title>US Launches Investigation Into Tesla's Autopilot System</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6268%2Fan_illustration_of_a_parked_tesla.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigation stems from 11 incidents in which drivers using Tesla’s Autopilot feature struck stationary first-responder vehicles. US auto regulators have launched an investigation into Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance system, Autopilot, ramping up scrutiny of Elon Musk’s self-driving efforts.  What isn’t Autopilot? Investors are not not worried—Tesla shares sank more than 4% on the news.</description>

  <title>Exploring the Cost of the War in Afghanistan</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6245%2Fus_copter_in_afghanistan.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The war has also cost the US an astronomical sum—$2.26 trillion to be exact, according to the Brown University Costs of War project. Big picture: Since the US invasion in 2001, more than 47,000 Afghan civilians and nearly 2,500 US troops have died in the conflict. The US-trained Afghan military was easily overwhelmed by the Taliban’s advance in a matter of weeks.   A few noticeable improvements in Afghanistan over the past two decades include increased life expectancy (56 years → 64) and a jump in the literacy rate (rising 8%, to 43%).</description>

  <title>Money Matters: Taking the Plunge on a House</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ir9ooRoyKZY8pRCJze/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owning a home can make for a great investment. However, just because you can buy a house doesn’t mean you’re ready. For some, it’s much more appealing to rent so that you can dial up a landlord when your AC unit freezes over (not speaking from experience). Oh, and some more cash for a down payment—somewhere between 5% and 20% of the purchase price.</description>

Offices are still empty: 75% of respondents are working fully remote, while 20% head in a few times a week. But they like working from home: 66% of readers said working from home during the pandemic was better than expected.</description>

  <title>Economists’ Fall Plans // The Delta Variant</title>

The dive was primarily sparked by concerns surrounding the Delta variant. It’s not just consumers going blue.</description>

  <title>The Taliban Is Taking Over Afghanistan and Its Drug Trade</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6238%2Fafghanistan_jump-starts_a.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Taliban now effectively controls all of southern Afghanistan, and US officials told the NYT that the Biden administration is preparing for the possibility of the Afghan government collapsing within the next month. The Taliban has also started peddling meth recently. But the Taliban didn’t just beef up its drug supply. Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer of opium, which most heroin is derived from: 84% of all the world’s opium was sourced from the country from 2015–20, per the UN’s World Drug Report.  Bottom line: The Taliban’s power grab likely means more heroin and meth will be pushed into the hands of dealers and users around the world.</description>

  <title>The New Office Small-Talk: Are You Vaccinated?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4816%2Fvaccine_dartboard.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colleagues are now spilling the beans about their vaccination experience and showing off their proof of vaccination on social media.  Although the spread of the Delta variant has injected new uncertainties into return-to-work plans, many execs, who have called remote work “an aberration” and not for young people “who want to hustle,” are intent on bringing employees back to the office—or have done so already. They cited the newness of the vaccine and possible side effects as the reasons for their vaccine hesitancy.  Morgan, the HR consultant, said it was natural for people to talk about the pandemic and the vaccine with their coworkers, but HR should remind them “to be respectful and civil toward each other, regardless of vaccination status.” But can employers require their workers to be vaccinated? “I have all of my other vaccines and have gotten the flu shots most years,” Michelle said. Unvaccinated workers were required to wear masks all the time outside of their cubes, while the vaccinated were free to drop them. If my work mandates it, I don’t know what I’ll do,” Michelle said. Not getting a vaccine =/= being an “anti-vaxxer” In a June survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 10% of American adults said they would “wait and see” before getting vaccinated, 6% would get inoculated only if required, while 14% would definitely not get the vaccine. Google, Facebook and Target have reinstituted mask mandates regardless of vaccination status. Michelle recalled that a coworker at a return-to-work meeting yelled, “What if I sit in a chair that was previously occupied by an unvaccinated person and bring back the virus to my kid?” That’s because Michelle, who chose to stay anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, has chosen to not yet get vaccinated against Covid-19. If they have both vaccinated and unvaccinated workers in the office, companies might need to enforce two different sets of policies. “It'd be way easier to just get the jab, but I would prefer to see long-term impacts and more data on side effects for people with my medical history,” she said.  Both Michelle and Monica are in the “wait-and-see” group.  “I’ve always thought that maybe in the future [I will get vaccinated] as more time passes and more is known,” Michelle said. The employer trusts employees to accurately report their vaccination status.</description>

  <title>The Taliban Is Taking Over Afghanistan and Its Drug Trade</title>

One of the many ramifications of the Taliban’s onslaught: It could pour fuel on the illegal drug market. Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer of opium, which most heroin is derived from: 84% of all the world’s opium was sourced from the country from 2015–20, per the UN’s World Drug Report.  Bottom line: The Taliban’s power grab likely means more heroin and meth will be pushed into the hands of dealers and users around the world.</description>
