  <title>Small Company, Big Moves: A Guide to Disruptive Investing</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3162/disruptive.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  It’s more important to focus on companies who are disrupting industries that will be around for the long haul.   The world is changing faster than ever, and with the right companies in your portfolio, you can be one of the people helping it change for the better.   And as more and more of these organizations look to IPO or woo investors, learning what to look for can be the difference between spotting a unicorn and riding something into the ground. If it’s a new industry, who’s name do you hear over and over?   This is also the time to really take a look at the leader of this company.   Disrupt Smartly There are no sure things, and that is especially true when investing in small, innovative companies.   So we asked our investing friends at The Motley Fool to help us know what to look for before we get disruptive with our investing. There are no shortage of companies claiming to be disrupting something.</description>

  <title>Moderna Vaccine Was 95% Effective in Phase 3 Trials</title>

That rally comes despite rising U.S. cases and new restrictions, which could disproportionately hurt small-cap's profits this quarter, the WSJ reports. Yesterday, Moderna announced its vaccine was 94.5% effective in Phase 3 clinical trials, just one week after Pfizer bragged its vaccine was over 90% effective.</description>
