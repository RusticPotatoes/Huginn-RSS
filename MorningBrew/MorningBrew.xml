  <title>How Tim Cook Changed Apple in the 10 Years He's Been CEO</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/TLm3ig25UPL7roCPLC/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s right, Cook has been the CEO of Apple for exactly 10 years this week. Cook still has plenty of problems to deal with, from high-stakes legal challenges against Apple’s App Store policies to a more vocal workforce to thorny privacy questions. While the iPhone still reigns supreme, Apple has expanded its hardware lineup in the last decade and scored hits with the Apple Watch and AirPods.  Apple’s annual revenue in 2011, when Cook took over, was $108.2 billion; in 2020 it made $274.5 billion. It also made a big move into services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, etc.</description>

  <title>Same-day Streaming Causes Movie Piracy to Ramp Up</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3303%2Ftv_movie_theater.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While streaming platforms may recoup some money lost to piracy via digital rentals and subscriber growth (which has boomed for Disney+, HBO Max, and Netflix), theaters won’t see a cent of that. Black Widow was the most pirated movie in the world for three weeks running after it was released on Disney+ and in theaters on July 9, according to piracy-monitoring site TorrentFreak. What pirated movies used to look like: shaky camcorder recordings of movies taken in theaters and uploaded to piracy sites. Black Widow, The Suicide Squad, Jungle Cruise, and other would-be blockbusters simultaneously debuted in theaters and on streaming services in summer 2021. Theater owners are blaming the recent phenomenon of same-day releases for a spike in piracy.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Happiness Expert Dr. Laurie Santos</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6395%2Fdr_laurie_santos.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But joking aside, I think one of the things you learn when you study primates in particular is that humans really are just animals ultimately.  The most important tip is realizing that rejection really hurts. On the one hand, pictures can help us remember things better, which helps us to access all our fondest moments. But the good news is that those self-reports are valid for happiness and well-being. Take time to write down the things you like about yourself, why you’re valued. So really the best way to know if you're happy is to ask yourself. One of the great things about being the person who teaches a happiness class is that I have to practice what I preach.  The best way to know if you're happy is to ask yourself, “How am I feeling right now?” But if taking pictures means that you're worrying about how your hair looks or forcing people out of the moment to take a picture, then they might not be such a good idea.   Santos was kind enough to grant us time during office hours to ask a few questions. Meet up with the people who really care about you, and if you can't meet up with them directly, then do some “social snacking” and just look at pictures of people who are close to you. That’ll allow you to have a memento that will help you remember after the fact.</description>

  <title>Unique Supply Chain Issues Cause Shortages in the UK</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6391%2Fbig_ben_cogs_in_the_clock_supply_chain.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These shortages are exacerbated by one broken cog in the supply chain: a lack of truck—err, lorry—drivers. And while driver shortages are a problem in many countries, the UK’s are due to a more unusual set of circumstances than just “the pandemic.” Gas station pumps are running dry, compounding supply chain issues.  The bigger picture: The UK is facing historic shortages across the board due to supply chain snags that are hitting the country harder than the White Queen clobbered Ron. A sampling:Iconic halal chicken joint Nando’s is feeling less cheeky after closing about 50 restaurants because of poultry shortages.</description>

Morehead: If people want to invest in Dogecoin and it's been working for six or eight years and even more people want to invest in it 10 years from now and the value keeps going up? The estimates for the number of crypto users in the US are at around 6% of the population and in some countries that is getting closer to 10%. A lot of the users who are coming into some of the crypto games have never been in crypto before and so the games are sort of their first foray. Then a community can decide what to do with that work of art where they can decide to sell it or buy more art or commission a different artist to create a new work. They didn't hold back, weighing in on everything from crypto games and altcoins to NFTs and DAOs. Our panel included Dan Morehead, the founder and CEO of Pantera Capital, which calls itself the first U.S. institutional asset manager focused exclusively on blockchain; Jose Fernandez da Ponte, vice president and general manager of blockchain, crypto, and digital currencies at PayPal; and Ali Yahya and Arianna Simpson, both general partners working in crypto at venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Simpson: I think we have seen only the very first inning of what's going to happen in NFTs. If I think about this in a five- to 10-year horizon kind of way, my expectation is that we'll see a lot of NFT use cases that have nothing to do with art and are completely different in nature. Now crypto has begun to graduate from its infrastructure phase and become ready for the application phase, where the technology is now capable of supporting real applications that can touch millions of users. As much as I've always expected crypto to become massive, the speed at which it happens is still kind of staggering. We hosted an event [recently] and I think one thing that struck me was that the people in the crowd were all really cool—much cooler than me and people like me who are crypto-native and have been in the space for a long time. I don't think there's any risk that, 10 years from now, we're going to find out blockchain didn't make it. Distributed ledger technology itself will be an asset class and it's going to disrupt a lot of things like currency. It just seemed like I should devote essentially the second half of my career to investing in it. I think 10 years from now, bitcoin is going to be an asset class and nobody is going to think anything of it. What was it like at the beginning, making the move to invest in this new thing called cryptocurrency? So I think crypto eventually becomes similar to the internet in the way that it interacts with and overlaps with different sectors. The number [of people saying that] is going down, but a lot of people still think I'm crazy.   Yahya: One thing that's surprising in a good way is that crypto is so interdisciplinarity—it brings together computer science, finance, economics, games theory, and now art. That is an important distinction—it's really bringing crypto to the forefront of people who weren't that into it before and were not necessarily tech native folks. Other use cases that are very interesting are things like digital identity. It's going to take bitcoin 20 years to do that. It’s a mechanism that you can use to organize human activity, but it's really heavyweight and you can only really do it for big things. But there's something interesting going on there. -Ed.]Yahya: The best way to think of a DAO is as the most digitally native way of organizing a community. Maybe we're too early or maybe it's a bubble right now and it's going to go down for five years before it ultimately goes up. I think that balance that we are seeing play out in the news every day is going to be one of the fundamental aspects of the speed of development. We are now entering a very interesting moment in time in which you can see more or less an inflection point for crypto. It’s just interesting to see how the technology penetrates increasingly different concentric circles. What advice do you have for people who may want to begin investing in crypto? We invested in things like stablecoins and some of the kind of financial primitives that are now part of DeFi, like Uniswap. Morehead: The current surprise is NFT pricing, but I still think NFT is really important. At the end of the day, a lot of people hold themselves back because they think they need some sort of external validation. Take a look at CryptoKitties, which really took off in 2017 and sort of catalyzed what eventually became the NFT [non-fungible token] movement and the crypto games movement. So I think the people should look at it carefully and accept that we are just at an early stage of the technology. I think that we will still need some time for that to mature. Morehead: When I got reintroduced to crypto in 2013, it was in the beginning of what would be a bubble that year. But there's a deeper way to think about it—that it’s yet another way of building a community. It's hundreds of different things and being a currency is just one of those. It's a way to move money around without paying a central third party. You end up with a lot of communities of people that believe in something very strongly. I don't think that anyone should be investing amounts of money that they cannot afford to lose.  Fernandez da Ponte: I don't think the volatility of the assets has surprised me; it’s something that you can expect in this space. We were at the beginning of what is now a very clear inflection point for crypto as a space. So I spun out and started my fund Autonomous Partners, which was really geared toward investing across the crypto space. The first one is people.  Simpson: It's the kind of thing that's very easy to dismiss. You can do it for something as small as a piece of media, and create a community around a work of art. So for me to want to leave that and go to a three-person bitcoin company was a very odd move to most people. I don't think that we are there yet, but we are getting close to that. You have to think about it as a completely new thing. But I think there are crazy prices being paid for things that, 100 years from now, people probably won't remember. In a very short period of time, the community has grown from the fundamental developments around bitcoin and ethereum to the next layer which is DeFi where you have a lot of new things that are built on those protocols that are enabling use cases that you could not think of three years ago. There are a bunch of protocols that move data around that we now call the internet. It started in the ‘70s and it's just now doing all of these cool things. Morehead: Try and get a portfolio of assets. If you have been following NFTs over the last six months, there was a lot of interest and then it felt like they disappeared for a while and now they are back.  Historically, crypto has seemed very difficult to get into or a little bit intimidating, so games are a means for people to start interacting with some of the concepts and be able to learn about it in a less threatening way. For example, I mentioned crypto games. You can approach it from the computer science or crypto-anarchist side, or you can approach it from the creative side. I tried to get Facebook to do something in crypto, but I was four or five years too early, so nothing came of it. Younger generations in particular like to attribute value to different things, so it's easy for older or more traditional investors to just be like, “Oh, this is nonsense.”  I think one of the best signs that there's something big happening is that central banks are now creating their own blockchain, which is an amazing testament to how important this is.   Simpson: My crypto journey started in Zimbabwe. Morehead: There's a lot of interesting topics in there. In reality, you're probably not going to get that.  Simpson: Crypto started as a sector unto itself, but what we're seeing is that it's becoming more of a layer of the technology stack and less of its own sector. So if you want to see where things are going, you really need to look at who's building it, because they will be the ones who put in all the hard work over periods of years or decades in order to build the future of whatever it is that is being built. Over time, you build a baseline of knowledge, so don't feel like you can’t start. Yahya: It's interesting to see how the technology has become mainstream. In the long run, we're going to look back and realize some very important pieces of work are being created right now. In the same way, we're seeing that area of overlap between crypto and other sectors. There's going to be some of that. Morehead: There was a long time where I worried about whether or not bitcoin would work or would get hacked. Big tech companies weren’t going anywhere. We continue to invest very much in infrastructure, but we have widened our lens and now focus on areas like crypto games or certain consumer facing financial applications, none of which was possible seven or eight years ago.  For the longest time, we have been in the infrastructure phase for crypto.</description>

  <title>Unique Supply Chain Issues Cause Shortages in the UK</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6391%2Fbig_ben_cogs_in_the_clock_supply_chain.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; These shortages are exacerbated by one broken cog in the supply chain: a lack of truck—err, lorry—drivers. The UK is facing historic shortages across the board due to supply chain snags that are hitting the country harder than the White Queen clobbering Ron. A sampling:Iconic halal chicken joint Nando’s is feeling less cheeky after closing about 50 restaurants because of poultry shortages. And while driver shortages are a problem in many countries, the UK’s are due to a more unusual set of circumstances than just “the pandemic.” Gas station pumps are running dry, compounding supply chain issues.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: Getting the Right Mix</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ixZmwZC0R1Zi87EOqG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much money should I be investing and saving in cash every month?

Perhaps only Elon Musk appears in this newsletter as much as inflation, which is just one reason not to hoard more cash than is necessary.</description>
