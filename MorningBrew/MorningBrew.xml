  <title>Social Media Platforms Have Prepared for a Confusing Election Day</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3012/crazy_day_on_social_media.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The run-up   Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent bouts with fake news have forced social media execs to enact new policies targeting misinformation, election interference, and conspiracy theories.   Advertising: Last fall, Twitter and TikTok banned all political ads. In 2020, social media platforms have become a go-to source for election information—and misinformation. Platforms have expanded their arsenals this election cycle to help voters through a confusing time. Slowing virality: Twitter added extra friction to retweets, and Facebook and Instagram are lightly pressing the brake on viral content this week. Think twice about sharing and use the Brew's guide to fact checking social media.</description>

  <title>Why Europe Locked Down—Again</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2951/europe_lockdown.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The moves made the Continent’s stock markets swoon  The Stoxx 600, a pan-European index, suffered its worst one-day drop since September ahead of Macron’s announcement.   France’s neighbor Germany also enacted a partial, month-long lockdown.   Bottom line: The U.S. and Europe have resoundingly failed to hold onto the progress made over the summer against the virus.   The WHO said the European region accounted for almost half of the new Covid-19 cases reported last week. German restaurants, bars, gyms, concert halls, and theaters will close starting Nov. 2.</description>

  <title>The Perfect Investment Does Not Exist</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2958/primary.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investing in the stock market can feel that way, too.   The market will always ebb and flow, but if you take a long term approach to investing with money you can afford to let sit and grow, the best time to start is still ASAP. Then use your time to stay informed on certain sectors, read up on quarterly earnings reports of big companies, and earmark that cash to invest the next time there’s a market downturn. The idea of perfect timing doesn’t apply to smart investing—leave that to boarding escalators and planning the perfect proposal. It’s human nature to plan for the perfect moment—be it proposing to your partner on a beach with an airplane banner, or landing the perfect step on an escalator at the mall.</description>

  <title>How to Sell a Haunted House</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2991/halloween_haunted_house.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  So how do you sell a haunted house?   That seems to be the exception to rule, because haunted houses are typically not an easy sell. Both Lynnewood Hall (dubbed the world's largest haunted house) in Elkins Park, PA, and the house from The Silence of the Lambs are on the market. Depends on the state  In New York, if the seller has "claimed to the public at large" that the house is haunted, he or she must disclose the spooky status to buyers.   Believe it or not, hauntedness is a legal designation in the real estate industry.</description>

  <title>The Historical Performance of the Stock Market Based on Presidential Party</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/931/stock_exchange.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  What does that mean for stocks?   Regardless of party, the S&amp;P performs better in a president’s first term than in the second.   Stocks have typically gained more when either party holds a simple majority in the Senate—not more than 60 of the 100 seats.   Bank of America Global Research analyzed historic S&amp;P performance under presidents from both parties.   Investors wish they could take a long weekend in Aruba, but in 2020 there’s no such thing: Tomorrow is Election Day, which will determine what party holds power in D.C. for the next few years.</description>

  <title>Social Media Platforms Have Prepared for a Confusing Election Day</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3012/crazy_day_on_social_media.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The run-up   Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent bouts with fake news have forced social media execs to enact new policies targeting misinformation, election interference, and conspiracy theories.   Advertising: Last fall, Twitter and TikTok banned all political ads. In 2020, social media platforms have become a go-to source for election information—and misinformation. Platforms have expanded their arsenals this election cycle to help voters through a confusing time. Slowing virality: Twitter added extra friction to retweets, and Facebook and Instagram are lightly pressing the brake on viral content this week. Think twice about sharing and use the Brew's guide to fact checking social media.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3013/mall_meme.png'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  During the strictest lockdown periods in the spring, Tennessee-based CBL barely collected any rent—just 27% of what it was owed in April and a third in May. Zoom out: Malls in general are in bad shape, but CBL and PREIT in particular?</description>

  <title>Q3 2020 Recap</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Jl4M6CA3Id6Op5SXRD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional golf has been underway for months with only minor testing headaches, while the pandemic-era versions of the Tour de France, the U.S. Open in tennis, and the Kentucky Derby went off smoothly. If the first two quarters of the year meant us coming to terms with a global pandemic, Q3 saw us settling into a ~new normal~ of face masks, parking lot dining, and saying "whoops, sorry!"   So what about K-12?   Q3 was the busiest for public offerings since the dot-com era.   That was a lot.   The election, for one.   Over the last three months, extreme weather events made more intense and frequent by human-induced climate change have ravaged communities across the country. There's actually good news.   Pulse check on the economic recovery  It's...   So why are biz leaders wearing out DocuSign?   Looking ahead On the monetary side...   On the corporate side...   On the fiscal side...   Looking ahead... School Reopenings Test Students, College Towns, and Parents After schools across the country closed their doors in the spring, John Krasinski hosted virtual prom, graduation ceremonies were streamed online, and at least one student accidentally said, “Sup, b****?”   Soccer: A  This summer, the National Women's Soccer League became the first major U.S. sports league to return to action from the Covid break, while the MLS has already welcomed fans back in certain states.    How the Economic Recovery Fared in Q3 As the ink dries on Q3, nearly 900,000 Americans are filing new jobless claims each week.   The Atlantic Coast produced so many big tropical storms that the World Meteorological Organization depleted its list of 21 names by September and is now using the Greek alphabet. Even where students can attend school, many parents have chosen not to enroll them. University of Iowa students angered Twitter (an easy feat, really) by lining up for downtown bars in Iowa City, which earlier this month had the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases per capita in the U.S. But for local businesses like The Airliner bar, students returning to campus is their only lifeline—revenue was $0 in April.   Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Parts of the West Coast have been ablaze since August, with a record 3.7 million acres burned across California. Climate change is no longer one of those problems. the M&amp;A could keep flowing, but experts think the IPO frenzy will settle by late October.   Whether you want to relive summer 2020 or would rather pretend it never happened, we present: the Brew's third quarter recap. Basketball: A+  Zero NBA players have tested positive for Covid-19 since entering the famous "bubble" in Orlando. The Tampa Bay Rays, the Brew’s July pick to win it all, entered the postseason as the top team in the American League. But with the election and a Supreme Court fight ahead, don't hold your breath for more emergency aid until the Christmas lights come out.</description>
