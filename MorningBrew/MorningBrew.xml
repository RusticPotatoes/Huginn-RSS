  <title>Inflation Is Rising Because the Economy Is Weird</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5060%2Finflation_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Is this rapid inflation growth temporary? Which brings us to the question raging among economists.  So, many officials are betting that once the economy irons out the wrinkles, price growth will settle down to more typical levels. US consumer prices rose 4.2% in April from a year ago, up from the 2.6% gain in March and more than economists expected. When goodbye hugs make a comeback and the rate of inflation hits its highest level in almost 13 years. “This number was well above what I and outside forecasters expected.”</description>

  <title>Will Crypto Rule the World?</title>

And while we don’t recommend a doge tat, we do recommend boning up on crypto, even knowing how volatile it is. Not only have cryptos checked that box, they’ve become major players in the $$$ world—aka finance.  And you’ve probably heard a thing or two about NFTs, a blockchain-based way to claim exclusive ownership of a piece of art, video clip, GIF, or even a newspaper column. The promise of DeFi is a financial system that’s more efficient, more tech-driven, and—dare we say it? decentralized finance, or DeFi. Why are those people so hyped? The idea of DeFi is pretty revolutionary.</description>
