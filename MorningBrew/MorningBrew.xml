  <title>FBI, International Authorities Arrest Hundreds In Encrypted Messaging App Sting</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/WoDqyh1EyxRR1LYsTi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FBI also helped spread Anom by distributing devices to 300+ gangs across 100 countries through middlemen.  As the FBI took down other encrypted communication services, more criminals started to DM using Anom's platform. For almost three years, criminals used a network of encrypted devices to share the dirty details of their smuggling and money laundering operations. The engineer was working on a new service, Anom, that stripped mobile phones of their normal functions and disguised a secure messaging app to look like a calculator.</description>

  <title>FDA Approves First Alzheimer's Drug to Treat Underlying Cause</title>

There's certainly money to be made: Biogen says the treatment, which will be sold under the name “Aduhelm,” will cost $56,000 a year.</description>

  <title>Apple Unveils New Privacy and Work Features at WWDC</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5368%2Fwwdc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  If Apple loses, the company may have to rewrite the rules of its money-printing App Store. Yesterday, Apple defended itself and said the App Store has paid over $230 billion to developers since opening in 2008. Apple kicked off its annual WWDC conference for developers with a keynote address showing off its new software features. Apple users will be able to block tracking by email senders, a change that could mean big disruptions for businesses that depend on email marketing. And trusted contacts to get you back into iCloud after you forget your new password. Fancier maps.</description>

However, Dr. Peter Marks of the FDA told CNN that vaccinated people likely won’t need a booster shot within a year of receiving their initial doses. Will I need to get a booster shot for Covid?

  <title>El Salvador Move to Adopt Bitcoin as Legal Tender</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4072%2Fbitcoin_as_dollars.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Why El Salvador? On Saturday, El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, said he’s going to send a bill to the legislature to make bitcoin a legal tender in the country. It’d be the first country to formally adopt the cryptocurrency as part of its economy.</description>

  <title>G-7 Ministers Agree to Corporate Minimum Tax</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1766%2Fformer_fed_chair_janet_yellen.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biden administration estimates a global minimum tax system would lead to $500 billion in additional tax revenue for the US over the next decade.  The provision is meant to address European leaders’ concerns that they can’t sufficiently tax tech giants like Facebook and Google, because while those companies make tons of money in Europe, they are based in the US and pay taxes there.   The backstory: Multinational companies have been taking advantage of existing tax rules by shuffling money between jurisdictions with super-low rates.</description>

  <title>Bill Ackman's Proposed SPAC Deal Confuses Just About Everyone</title>

  <title>May Jobs Report Offers Wins, Losses, And Some Hope</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/kC2cRqEt8o41COgjoV/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biggest job gains were in the leisure and hospitality sector, which added 292,000 new jobs, more than the 278,000 jobs the economy added in total in April. The number of workers who claimed unemployment because their employer lost business or closed due to the pandemic dropped by 1.5 million.</description>

  <title>Facebook Extends President Trump’s Ban For Two More Years</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5347%2Ftrump_banned_from_facebook.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zoom out: Trump’s blog’s failure is a reminder that social platforms like Facebook don’t just offer a place to share snarky opinions, but also an algorithm-amplified megaphone. Facebook had kept a special list of politicians who were allowed to bend its content moderation rules because their opinions were considered “newsworthy content that should, as a general rule, be seen and heard,” Facebook VP of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said in 2019.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with… Uma Valeti</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5348%2Fuma_valeti.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The company raised $161 million in Series B funding, which included investments from SoftBank Group, Bill Gates, Richard Branson, and Tyson Foods. Now for the last five years, I've been eating it again. The other thing to know is when to go fast and when to go slow. Now his company Upside Foods (previously Memphis Meats) is doing just that: growing real meat in a lab. But I made a promise to myself that I will only eat the meat that we produce.  No. I grew up in a meat-eating family, but during medical school, I stopped eating meat because I thought, "I don't like how meat is coming to the table." So that meant in the last five years, building the company up slowly so people would understand what we're trying to do. Absolutely don't look back because it looks scary if you start looking back. You can go fast on a lot of things, but you have to deliberately slow down for some really important moments. What's your favorite meal made out of Upside Foods's cell-grown meat?</description>

  <title>Paul vs. Mayweather: But...Why?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/CI0FSfRY1pTWjuYQvK/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Logan Paul, the social media star, will fight Floyd Mayweather Jr., considered one of the best boxers ever, in an exhibition match. If you are one of the many people who decide to watch (it'll likely be one of the most-viewed events of the year), you will probably not see a competitive fight. Paul, who only recently got into boxing, is 0–1 in his career. Paul's often been on the wrong side of law and order. My goal is to be the biggest entertainer on the planet. We don't know how much Logan will make from the match, but it's going to be a lot—Mayweather is poised to make $102 million tonight, according to The Sun.Bottom line: In the end, what Mayweather and the Paul brothers are really fighting for is our eyeballs.</description>
