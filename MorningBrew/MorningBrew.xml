  <title>House Democrats Will Try to Suspend the Debt Ceiling as Yellen Warns of "Catastrophe"</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ZsVGSlpm2PvxkUo/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e477b8uajsr95bjwrxsvg58kzz04w51ou0i2ojzl30t&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Without suspending the debt ceiling, the US wouldn’t be able to borrow money to pay its bills—and things would get ugly if that happened.   The Business Roundtable, an influential group of top executives, wrote that failure to suspend the debt ceiling could “produce an otherwise avoidable crisis and pose unacceptable risk” to the country’s economy and markets. House Democrats will make moves this week to suspend the $28.5 trillion debt ceiling as an October deadline fast approaches. Instead, it’s about spending Congress has already authorized, such as paying out Social Security.</description>

Child care is down 126,700 employees since before the pandemic, a drop of more than 10%.  Looking ahead...</description>

  <title>FDA Advisory Panel: Boomers Can Get Boosters</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7467%2Fvaccine_boosters.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;20, but some health experts (including two senior FDA officials) pushed back, saying there wasn’t enough data yet to show a third shot was necessary. That decision throws a wrench in the Biden administration’s plans to roll out boosters to US adults beginning next week.  Booster boosters also point to data from Israel, a country that has given booster shots to nearly 3 million people in the past several months. Other loud voices have urged the US to add a third shot to the standard vaccine regimen—voices like the vaccine makers themselves.</description>

  <title>In Atlanta, a Tech Hub Rises Among the Peach Orchards</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7459%2Fusa_georgia_atlanta_cit.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In other Atlanta tech deals last week... Microsoft will hire 1,500 people at its new Atlanta office, Apple is partnering on a $50 million tech center, and Airbnb, explicitly citing the prevalence of Black talent in Atlanta, also plans to open a hub in the city. The city is home to a cluster of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College.  Tech companies that have pledged to increase diversity in their workforces are eyeing Atlanta’s Black engineering talent. A recent string of deals has put Atlanta on the map as a growing power player in the US technology industry.</description>

  <title>Make It Work</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have an unlimited PTO policy. How do I ask for days off? Ask Shane here. One thing that’s not unlimited is your mental and physical health, so don’t cheat yourself out of the time you need to properly recharge. Each week, our workplace whisperer Shane Loughnane answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. HR Brew. Have a question about work you want to ask Shane? Try asking about the minimum amount of PTO they would expect you to take. They’ve empowered you to determine how much time off you can realistically take without compromising that work—and while I’d recommend a more modest approach until you get a feel for where that line is, I don’t think a few days off during the holidays is an unreasonable place to start. It’s a good move to ask your manager if they have any preferences.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Kat Cole</title>

And people are going to pay a premium for it. Like, I just got opportunities earlier than most people would. And where experience is valued, there still might be some automation in a piece of the production but that human element is going to be increasingly cherished. Probably every two months. Do you think your original position as a Hooters server will exist 10 years from now? What I think people might miss about my two long stints at the same parent enterprise is I was in super high-growth companies, and so really I was running multiple different companies—I just didn’t have to leave the entity to do it. The Cinnabon aroma is a bit more magic, and intoxicating, and the Auntie Anne’s aroma is kind of like, “Take all my money.” It’s indulgent, and I am satisfied almost just from that aroma. Then, she joined Focus Brands, the parent company of Cinnabon, Auntie Anne’s, and other chains, where she became President and COO. Yes, I learned over time to be a really thoughtful, caring, and driven leader, but you cannot remove a high-growth company from that equation.  Yes, I would make it fully remote, and I would put in some really killer and regular moments of in-person connection when it would be safe and possible.</description>
