  <title>FBI, International Authorities Arrest Hundreds In Encrypted Messaging App Sting</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/WoDqyh1EyxRR1LYsTi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FBI also helped spread Anom by distributing devices to 300+ gangs across 100 countries through middlemen.  As the FBI took down other encrypted communication services, more criminals started to DM using Anom's platform. For almost three years, criminals used a network of encrypted devices to share the dirty details of their smuggling and money laundering operations. The engineer was working on a new service, Anom, that stripped mobile phones of their normal functions and disguised a secure messaging app to look like a calculator.</description>

  <title>FDA Approves First Alzheimer's Drug to Treat Underlying Cause</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5369%2Flab.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the FDA approved Biogen's aducanumab, the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's (sticky brain plaques) and potentially slow the disease's progression in early stage patients. There's certainly money to be made: Biogen says the treatment, which will be sold under the name “Aduhelm,” will cost $56,000 a year.</description>

  <title>Apple Unveils New Privacy and Work Features at WWDC</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5368%2Fwwdc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  If Apple loses, the company may have to rewrite the rules of its money-printing App Store. Yesterday, Apple defended itself and said the App Store has paid over $230 billion to developers since opening in 2008. Apple kicked off its annual WWDC conference for developers with a keynote address showing off its new software features. Apple users will be able to block tracking by email senders, a change that could mean big disruptions for businesses that depend on email marketing. And trusted contacts to get you back into iCloud after you forget your new password. Fancier maps.</description>
