  <title>Q&amp;A: What Are Company Earnings, Why do They Affect Stocks?</title>

  <title>Consumer Prices Rise More Than Expected in March</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4715%2Fgas_pump_with_dollar_bills.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US consumer prices increased the most in nearly nine years in March: 0.6% over the prior month and 2.6% over last year. Some economists are concerned that too much stimulus will cause an overheated economy.   Looking ahead…the Fed expects a temporary bump in prices that will smooth out once supply chains figure their Suez out.</description>

The Nuance acquisition could catapult it ahead. er, nuance of human language.</description>
