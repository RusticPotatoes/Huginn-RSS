  <title>The TL;DR of Georgia's Voting Law</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3606%2Fgeorgia_peach.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US has a long history of suppressing voting access for Black and minority populations, and critics say this law continues that practice. More access in some cases: The GA law guarantees a minimum # of drop boxes for mail ballots per county, expands early voting in most small counties, and adds more resources to polling places where lines get long.

Hwang grew his own business 900% over seven years using complex financial tools called swaps.   It was the “biggest single-firm meltdown since the financial crisis,” per the WSJ, and it’s causing introspection in finance about the ability of private family offices to cause market havoc.</description>

  <title>Amazon Apologizes For Denying Delivery Drivers Have to Pee in Bottles</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4627%2Fus-it-politics-labor-amaz.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The backstory: A little over a week ago, Pocan tweeted that Amazon wasn’t a “progressive workplace” because its workers had to urinate in bottles. Things might be a little tense in the Amazon boardroom right now as it waits for the results of ~6,000 votes on whether warehouse workers in Alabama will unionize.</description>

  <title>HYBE Acquires Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings for $1 Billion</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FibpyzXXfbiy1UkGRRO%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYBE acquired Ithaca Holdings for about $1 billion yesterday, but unless you own some turntables, you might want a refresher on who these two audio giants are:HYBE is a South Korean music company formerly named Big Hit Entertainment. It’s unclear exactly what that’ll look like, but if BTS’s rabid “Army” fan club backs it, it’ll be big.</description>

  <title>US Hiring Surges in March With Bigger Rebound in Sight</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4621%2Fyou_re_hired_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The economy basically just raised a $1.9 trillion Series E in the form of Biden’s stimulus plan.    The biggest winners: Leisure and hospitality = 280,000 jobs added. The $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal he introduced this week, literally called the American Jobs Plan, would create 13.5 million jobs by the end of his first term, as opposed to 11.4 million without the plan, per Moody’s Analytics.
