  <title>Median worker pay at big companies is up</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://images.morningbrew.com/gif/2022-05-31/image-4fc4cdf060d47b4b1e6dc9e78f8f77dea6a1b01d-480x270-gif/giphy.webp'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Hiring sprees led to big shifts. At the majority of S&amp;P 500 companies, median worker pay has increased from 2019 levels—including 150 companies that reported an increase of 10% or more. —MK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In 2019, 56 companies reported a median worker compensation of less than $30,000, compared to 41 in 2021. Delta hired 13% of its total workforce in 2021 (11,000 people), so its median worker received 41% less compared to 2019. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeJust like they’re required to disclose top executive pay, US publicly traded companies are required to disclose the compensation of the median worker from their global staff. More than 140 companies reported that their median employee makes six figures, proving your parents’ advice to “write Netflix an email and ask them to let you make a movie” is pretty shrewd after all (Netflix’s median employee makes around $200k). Other interesting findings:12 out of the top 25 best compensated median employees worked at tech companies.</description>

  <title>Why crypto crashed, and what happens next</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/2d15b8a7bdedc0e7961e65cd26d92a895ed1f9c5-6000x4200.jpg?rect=0,100,6000,4000&amp;w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Ignoring what happened with Terra’s luna—which is not a true stablecoin because it wasn’t actually backed by any reserves, even though it was pegged to the dollar—imagine if you’re in a Facebook-type metaverse and want to conduct a transaction with another user. Crypto began to act like a risk asset. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. That’s a true use case. To me it’s all Web3, whereas crypto really goes back only to the blockchain. The first one occurred [in early 2015] when bitcoin stood by itself as a proven cryptocurrency, and there was potentially some investor disillusionment early on about what they held. There is a valuation framework that hasn’t been created yet but could be, showing true value for these blockchain operating systems, subsequently prompting public policy leaders to change their views on these assets. But because they used new software architecture, they attached a smart contract to the cover art so when the buyer sells it at significant multiples, 10% will go back to the original owners, again split between them. Most Morning Brew readers saw the cryptocurrency market plummet in early May. There’s been a lot of anxiety since—notable for an investment community that gave rise to the battle cry “HODL,” as in “hold on for dear life.” Many of our smarter investors are using this correction to do the work to understand the space better. When you say “crypto,” you’re not just talking about currencies, are you? They’re real and people have true use cases for them: supply chain efficiency, FEMA claim reduction, things to power the metaverses of the future. First, she didn’t understand how any crypto asset had intrinsic value. The total value of the crypto market was $780 billion in January 2021. As global head of crypto and digital assets strategy at Bank of America, it’s Shah’s job to figure out what’s happening for the second largest bank in the US. It’s not that there’s any end to this sector. Paul Krugman in the New York Times comes to mind; in May he wrote: “Cryptocurrencies play almost no role in economic transactions other than speculation in crypto markets themselves.” What’s another killer application of crypto?</description>

  <title>Marriage moves to the metaverse</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThough the Hurleys’ Decentraland wedding was a novelty, weddings in online virtual worlds aren’t particularly new—they’ve piqued the interest of gamers for years. “You think, too, ‘Okay, the virtual is automatically going to be less expensive as well,’ which is why you can see it appealing to a lot of people,” said Rachel Willis, a wedding planner who is watching the metaverse wedding industry but has yet to have a client who wants one. But the over-the-top apparel and man–animal hybrid didn’t bother Candice and Ryan, because the “anything goes” style of their guests fit perfectly with the couple’s location: Decentraland, an Ethereum-based virtual world where people can play games or buy land in the form of NFTs.“What’s great about the metaverse is you can just do whatever you want,” Candice Hurley told Morning Brew, noting the avatar she used in the 3D, virtual world wasn’t a reflection of her real-life self. ) Klaus Bandisch, wedding planner and owner of Just Maui Weddings, began offering meta “marriages” in Hawaiian destinations this year, though for now he’s focused on vow renewals because of state laws regulating remote weddings. ) “What we’ve developed is a blockchain marriage that’s recognized on the blockchain.” Those who hold virtual celebrations also need to wed in person with an officiant. Candice and Ryan aren’t the first couple to exchange vows in the metaverse. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. Then, they ran out of wedding favors. Blockchain technology, or an online public ledger, is largely associated with the transfer of cryptocurrencies, but it can potentially store important documents, like property deeds or marriage licenses, in a transparent and secure way. It can be just as expensive, but the realm of why people would decide to go with a virtual wedding…the sky’s the limit, really.” It wasn’t long after people started interacting online with avatars in virtual gaming worlds like Second Life and Runescape that people began to meet and wed in symbolic ceremonies, sometimes to advance in the game, and sometimes because they had caught feelings for the other player. Rose said her law firm has quoted people between $2,500 and $15,000 for meta weddings so far, depending on the customizations they choose. Candice and Ryan Hurley's avatars seen during their Decentraland wedding. Others were wearing crowns or brightly colored wigs, and one wore a bikini top with plaid pants. But as the lines between the virtual and tangible worlds fade, it may become more common to take vows in the metaverse. “People trust the new dating technology more and more, and the stigma of meeting online seems to have worn off,” Michael Rosenfeld, the study’s author, said of the findings.</description>

To help us become better talent spotters in a world where spotting talent is increasingly important, economist Tyler Cowen and venture capitalist and entrepreneur Daniel Gross wrote a book on the art and science of finding talent at the highest level. Many highly successful individuals are terrible at talent assessment. This interview has been condensed.</description>

When it’s combined, you see a robot doing the work of roughly two people during peak periods in a quiet, seamless, and very efficient way. We're not just going to wake up one day, and there’ll be 1.5 million new workers happily jumping into the restaurant industry. We really see ourselves as a solution to the labor crisis in the quick serve restaurant industry. from our sponsorFired up about Flippy and its robot siblings? When someone sees Flippy taking frozen fries all the way through to the cook station and serving cooked fries, you can kinda just drop the mic. What do you see Miso’s role in the restaurant industry? And the automation guy is saying, “I think that the technology has now evolved in such a way that it’s approachable and affordable today for a robot to take over some of the tasks.” What Flippy does is simple: It takes frozen fries all the way through the fry process and dispenses cooked fries. Yeah, so if you look at fast-food restaurants, fries go with almost every order. Miso is still open to investors as they take on the $300B US Quick Serve Restaurant Industry. I was talking to some of the workers who have had one of our Flippy units installed for the longest period of time. Our mission is to automate restaurants, and we’re starting with automating fry stations. Where did the idea for the Flippy come from?</description>

That being said, job switching continues to be one of the best ways to boost your stats on celebritynetworth. New research into the American job market shows that many people who recently quit their job for another one are pretty quickly itching to quit the new job, too.
