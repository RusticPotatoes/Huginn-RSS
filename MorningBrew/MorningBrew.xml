  <title>Suez Canal Blocked by Giant Container Ship Causes a Global Shipping Backup</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4492%2Fsuez_canal.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Tuesday, a gargantuan cargo ship named the Ever Given ran aground in the busy Suez Canal, blocking maritime traffic from entering or exiting the crucial shipping highway. If you're wondering how a ship that weighs 220,000 tons and is the size of the Empire State Building ended up sideways, canal officials say high winds from a sandstorm restricted visibility around the time the ship got stuck.  As of last night, over 100 ships were stuck at each end of the 120-mile canal, putting even more pressure on the global shipping industry that was already out of whack from the pandemic.</description>

  <title>How the CEO of Swivel Beauty Does Her Taxes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4489%2Fjihan_thompson.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s also important that they understand how you like to see the numbers. I’d never started a business before, so I was Googling everything from, “How do you incorporate your business?”  JT: You certainly don’t have to be one as a startup—plenty of businesses start out as LLCs or general C-corps—but a lot of the literature, at least that we read at the time, recommended this.    MB: How did you go about incorporating the business? New York City also had a grant program to help small business owners retain employees, especially when businesses were closed. One fun one was we were a recipient for a grant Beyoncé had with the NAACP.  JT: We started with a lawyer and ended up incorporating our business as a Delaware C-corp, which a lot of startups do. MB: Did Covid-19 affect anything about the way you’ll do your taxes this year? Make sure that you like who you’re working with because this is the important stuff. If you structure everything correctly from the beginning, when the money does start rolling in, you’re going to be really happy that you did.  JT: We did a lot of research online, like with anything. Having an accountant who really understood that and understood how money flowed through our business was incredibly important. Swivel was born out of wanting to solve a problem I had, but also because I knew a lot of other women who were struggling with this as well.  JT: I would say even if you’re not making a ton of money in the beginning, still set up the right processes when it comes to your business. Set up a separate business account. Again, because we’re a marketplace, we like to see how much money is flowing to each of the vendors on our platform.  Morning Brew: For those who don’t know, what is Swivel Beauty and how’d you come up with the business idea?</description>

  <title>US Regulatory Panel Questions AstraZeneca Vaccine Results</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4476%2Fastrazeneca.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wee hours of Tuesday morning, when nothing good ever happens, a panel that oversees US clinical trial safety said AstraZeneca's vaccine results may include "outdated and potentially misleading" data. Big picture: Vaccine hesitancy, in the US and abroad, started out higher than public health officials wanted. Add this to the growing listWhile AstraZeneca's vaccine has been authorized in 70+ countries, the rollout has faced Galaxy Note 7-level challenges. AstraZeneca's vaccine is less effective than Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines and (pending further data) potentially also Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot option.</description>

  <title>News Outlets Adjust to Life After Trump</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4473%2Fold_news.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few months into the new Biden administration, news consumption has significantly declined, according to the Washington Post. If you haven’t felt the itch to check Twitter 24/7, skim your preferred news site, or keep cable news humming in the background since President Trump left office, join the club. Politics consumption on major new sites dropped 28% from January to February, according to analytics company SimilarWeb, but interest in business and finance news only slightly declined over the same period.    The Washington Post is going the opposite route.</description>

Throw in the onset of a global pandemic, more efficient ways of receiving news (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn), and door-busting subscription deals, and conditions were ripe for news outlets to thrive.  TV: CNN lost almost half of its primetime viewership in the key 25–54 demographic in the period between President Biden's inauguration and March 15.</description>
