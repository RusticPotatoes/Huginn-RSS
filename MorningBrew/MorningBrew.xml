  <title>Traditional IPO vs SPAC: Everything You Need to Know About Taking Your Company Public</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F931%2Fstock_exchange.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a company to go public via a SPAC, a SPAC has to want to take that company public. But with 400+ SPACs strolling around with a box of donuts begging new companies to join them for a “new kind of worship,” companies have a lot of opportunities to, um, SPAC it up. Coinbase, the crypto exchange, used a direct listing to go public Wednesday. A reverse merger is when a private company merges with any public company—it doesn’t have to be a shell company—and goes public in the process. A SPAC raises money through the IPO process, and then merges with a private company and takes it public. In a Dutch auction, the company decides the number of shares, but not how much they will cost.  Why would a company want to go public in the first place? A SPAC is formed before it even knows what it wants to do with its life. A private company goes public without any of the underwriting hullabaloo. SPACs might feel like a hot new craze, but they aren’t new. Reverse mergers were popular in the ’80s for pretty much the same reason SPACs are popular right now, but the SEC cracked down in 2011 when it issued a fraud warning about reverse mergers and suspended trading for more than 800 companies. There are other ways to take your company public. But have no fear, someone somewhere will come up with something new... In a direct listing, the company goes public by bypassing investment banks that buy up a lot of initial shares and decide its opening price. They have become increasingly popular because they help companies go public a lot quicker (a few weeks to months) and less time = fewer fees.</description>

  <title>Black Investors Trade Their Way Through the Pandemic</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5083%2Frobinhood_black_wall_street.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  29% of young Black Americans became first-time investors in 2020, compared to 16% of white Americans.  Because when you look at the types of people who have typically invested in stocks, Black Americans are less represented. According to the Ariel-Schwab Black Investor Survey, 63% of Black Americans under the age of 40 are now participating in the stock market, the same share as white Americans.  Here’s the lesser-known story: That surge in individual trading was led by a historic rise in the number of Black investors getting into the stock market. For Ross and Mac, it’s not surprising that cryptocurrency, with its promise to bypass entrenched financial institutions, is particularly enticing to Black investors.  For Ross and other Black Americans who grew up in disadvantaged communities (Ross is the first person in his family to graduate from high school), more access to the stock market via mobile apps means an unprecedented opportunity to grow wealth and participate in a financial system that at one point seemed so distant.  On the audio app Clubhouse, Ross Mac runs a weekly chat called Black Wealth Matters, which aims to help build “generational wealth in the Black community.”  Not having any money invested in the stock market can dramatically harm your ability to build wealth down the road. Mac, a former Wall Street analyst and financial literacy teacher, says that the pandemic has created a rush of excitement around stocks and investing among Black Americans. )Did the proliferation of no-fee trading apps contribute to the wave of new Black investors that emerged over the last year? It’s a very easy thing for us to get and understand because as a people we’ve been shut out,” Ross said.</description>

  <title>Fantasy Investing Competition Update</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5087%2Fleaderboard.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Bottom line: The average return among all 10,000 players was -1.51%, so if you had just sat on your initial capital and didn’t make a single trade, you’d be in pretty good shape. The most creative strategy, however, goes to writer Matty Merritt, who tripled down on her Nebraska roots with a portfolio made exclusively from corn.</description>

But responses have been all over the board:Yesterday, Walmart said that fully vaccinated customers and employees won’t need to wear masks unless required by local laws.</description>

The most creative strategy, however, goes to writer Matty Merrit, who tripled down on her Nebraska roots with a portfolio made solely from corn.</description>

Ask Kate for advice here. I just read your response to the person looking at changing jobs. —AshleyA: Hi Ashley, I’m sorry that your experience at work has turned into a sour one. Do you have any advice on how to have that conversation gracefully? Notices longer than two weeks is an awesome look on you, too (side note: I would recommend a minimum of three weeks if you’re at the Director level or higher). And please please give your employer a two-week notice, meaning 10 full business days, at minimum. Oh!</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Barbara Corcoran</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5071%2Fbarbara_corcoran.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I go to the beach, and I’m always on my phone when I never used to be. That’s what I would want to have, it has never left me. I flipped the cards and said “Oh my god you’re going to get fired.” Who would ever know that that’s fun?  Yeah, I’m going to do that...  What are you into now that you never thought you would be into? I think about it a lot, I don’t know why it’s stuck in my gut. Do you think that’s true? He’s outrageous and you know you’re going to have a blast. I feel like I’m looking right into their soul. Every single card was negative I don’t think I had a worse reading, and the kid was so frightened, and what do you know two months later he was fired. When people are good with their eye contact, even if after a while they have to look down when they start getting scared, but when they initially get out there and make good eye contact, they’re always good entrepreneurs. I’m going to leave my phone in Manhattan. I’m a helluva good tarot card reader. I had no TV, no radio, no phone, and I don’t think I’ve known that degree of relaxation probably for the last 15 years. I gotta believe that if someone wants what they want is going to find a way to not have that happen. And I see right away this person is going to fold under pressure. I’m going to do that this summer. And I think life has gotten tough on people, interviewing online.  I think there’s truth in it because I know one exceptional individual who epitomizes that and that’s Mark Cuban. I will probably feel young again and relaxed.  The strangest reading I ever gave was we had a boondoggle party at my apartment, this was going back maybe four years ago, I had just hired a new social media head guy who will remain nameless. but of all those people, if someone had bad lighting, didn’t look in the camera eye, they weren’t even considered. And he said, “Could I go first?” They want a guy as a partner and that’s where it ends—and you can tell right away when they stand on that set.  How did you get into Tarot cards? And this new guy, first day on the job, we’re sitting and we had a half hour to kill and there were my tarot cards on the coffee table I said, “Hey, why don’t we read cards while we’re waiting for everyone else to come.” You know, I had the word should, but I am going to do that now.</description>

I’m going to leave my phone in Manhattan. I’m a helluva good tarot card reader. I went to a real estate conference at a young age and it was the first time I rented a booth, trying to hustle business straight from other brokers. I will probably feel young again and relaxed.  Yes, but even when they’re not making eye contact because they’re intimidated I’m out right away. And I’ve lived long enough to see that most of what I’ve predicted has proved out. I’m going to do that this summer. I had no TV, no radio, no phone, and I don’t think I’ve known that degree of relaxation probably for the last 15 years.</description>

  <title>Hertz Shareholders Win Big With Bankruptcy Deal</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5078%2Fdaily_life_in_new_york_ci.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the trading frenzy last June, Hertz topped out at $6.25 a share, which means if you were the fool who bought Hertz at its peak, you’d still have been undervaluing the company. Last June, a gang of Robinhood traders helped push the rental car’s stock up nearly 600% in less than a week, which was a curious thing to do considering the company had just filed for bankruptcy, was weighed down by nearly $19 billion in debt, and had roughly 700,000 cars parked with no one to drive them. But they were vindicatedThis week, Hertz reached a deal with a couple private equity firms to take it out of bankruptcy. He predicted “there will be no recovery for the shareholders.  </description>

US commercial casinos raked in $11.1 billion last quarter, according to the American Gaming Association, matching their best quarter ever. And both traditional and new-ish sectors of the US gambling industry are seeing the benefits. What happened?</description>

The Renaissance IPO ETF, which holds a number of recently public companies such as Pinterest, Coinbase, Roblox, and Slack, has fallen nearly 30% from its peak in February.  But the drooping share prices of freshly public companies is enough to spook some private firms from taking the IPO plunge.</description>
