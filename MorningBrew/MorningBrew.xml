Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribePresident Biden made sure of that by delivering a rare prime-time address to the nation last night, urging Congress to pass laws that could help curb the gun violence that’s sweeping the country. President Biden’s prime-time address also reflects the government’s greater focus on the issue. What’s not on the table: an assault weapons ban. The House could vote on it next week, but even if it gets through the chamber, it’s expected to be quashed by the evenly split Senate (where it would need 10 Republican votes, or 60 total, to pass). —NF “For God’s sake, how much more carnage are we willing to accept?” css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Police said the shooter was targeting the surgeon who had recently performed his back surgery. Those measures include expanding background checks, buttressing school security, and implementing red flag laws that allow law enforcement to take guns away from people deemed high-risk of harming themselves or others. So what’s on the table? Biden rarely interrupts your evening TV binge to make a speech, having done it only for annual addresses to Congress and remarks on the one-year anniversary of the Covid pandemic.</description>

Zoom out: ABG could be preparing for a resurgence of Elvis enthusiasm over the new Baz Luhrmann biopic, Elvis, which is set to release June 24. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe group that licenses Elvis Presley merch, Authentic Brands Group (ABG), sent cease-and-desist letters last month to a number of Las Vegas chapels in an attempt to quash their Elvis-themed weddings. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! But ABG does claim the rights to the artist’s name and likeness, as well as the words “Elvis,” “Elvis Presley,” and “The King of Rock and Roll.” How many people want Elvis to marry them? Melody Willis-Williams, president of Vegas Weddings and Viva Las Vegas Weddings, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that she does thousands of sequined, “Burning Love”-esque weddings every year. The details: Nevada law says ABG can’t stop Elvis impersonators from shaking their hips any more than parents in the ’60s. The trademark battle poses a threat to the small chapels’ post-pandemic recovery and Vegas’s $2 billion wedding industry.</description>

But ABG does claim the rights to the artist’s name and likeness, as well as the words “Elvis,” “Elvis Presley,” and “The King of Rock and Roll.” How many people want Elvis to marry them? Melody Willis-Williams, president of Vegas Weddings and Viva Las Vegas Weddings, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that she does thousands of sequined, “Burning Love”-esque weddings every year. The details: Nevada law says ABG can’t stop Elvis impersonators from shaking their hips any more than parents in the ’60s. The trademark battle is an existential threat to the small chapels’ post-pandemic recovery and Vegas’s $2 billion wedding industry.</description>

  <title>Why crypto crashed, and what happens next</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Ignoring what happened with Terra’s luna—which is not a true stablecoin because it wasn’t actually backed by any reserves, even though it was pegged to the dollar—imagine if you’re in a Facebook-type metaverse and want to conduct a transaction with another user. Crypto began to act like a risk asset. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. That’s a true use case. To me it’s all Web3, whereas crypto really goes back only to the blockchain. The first one occurred [in early 2015] when bitcoin stood by itself as a proven cryptocurrency, and there was potentially some investor disillusionment early on about what they held. There is a valuation framework that hasn’t been created yet but could be, showing true value for these blockchain operating systems, subsequently prompting public policy leaders to change their views on these assets. But because they used new software architecture, they attached a smart contract to the cover art so when the buyer sells it at significant multiples, 10% will go back to the original owners, again split between them. Most Morning Brew readers saw the cryptocurrency market plummet in early May. There’s been a lot of anxiety since—notable for an investment community that gave rise to the battle cry “HODL,” as in “hold on for dear life.” Many of our smarter investors are using this correction to do the work to understand the space better. When you say “crypto,” you’re not just talking about currencies, are you? They’re real and people have true use cases for them: supply chain efficiency, FEMA claim reduction, things to power the metaverses of the future. First, she didn’t understand how any crypto asset had intrinsic value. The total value of the crypto market was $780 billion in January 2021. As global head of crypto and digital assets strategy at Bank of America, it’s Shah’s job to figure out what’s happening for the second largest bank in the US. It’s not that there’s any end to this sector. Paul Krugman in the New York Times comes to mind; in May he wrote: “Cryptocurrencies play almost no role in economic transactions other than speculation in crypto markets themselves.” What’s another killer application of crypto?</description>

But the over-the-top apparel and man–animal hybrid didn’t bother Candice and Ryan, because the “anything goes” style of their guests fit perfectly with the couple’s location: Decentraland, an Ethereum-based virtual world where people can play games or buy land in the form of NFTs.“What’s great about the metaverse is you can just do whatever you want,” Candice Hurley told Morning Brew, noting the avatar she used in the 3D, virtual world wasn’t a reflection of her real-life self. ) Klaus Bandisch, wedding planner and owner of Just Maui Weddings, began offering meta “marriages” in Hawaiian destinations this year, though for now he’s focused on vow renewals because of state laws regulating remote weddings. ) “What we’ve developed is a blockchain marriage that’s recognized on the blockchain.” Those who hold virtual celebrations also need to wed in person with an officiant. Candice and Ryan aren’t the first couple to exchange vows in the metaverse. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. Then, they ran out of wedding favors. Blockchain technology, or an online public ledger, is largely associated with the transfer of cryptocurrencies, but it can potentially store important documents, like property deeds or marriage licenses, in a transparent and secure way. It can be just as expensive, but the realm of why people would decide to go with a virtual wedding…the sky’s the limit, really.” It wasn’t long after people started interacting online with avatars in virtual gaming worlds like Second Life and Runescape that people began to meet and wed in symbolic ceremonies, sometimes to advance in the game, and sometimes because they had caught feelings for the other player. Rose said her law firm has quoted people between $2,500 and $15,000 for meta weddings so far, depending on the customizations they choose. Candice and Ryan Hurley's avatars seen during their Decentraland wedding. Others were wearing crowns or brightly colored wigs, and one wore a bikini top with plaid pants. But as the lines between the virtual and tangible worlds fade, it may become more common to take vows in the metaverse. “People trust the new dating technology more and more, and the stigma of meeting online seems to have worn off,” Michael Rosenfeld, the study’s author, said of the findings.</description>

Given the shortage of workers in other age cohorts, more teens are working now than they have since the 2008–09 financial crisis. Even after dangling a $2,500 incentive, the city can’t find enough staff. And a lack of lifeguards could prevent one-third of the 300,000+ public pools in the US from opening this summer, the American Lifeguard Association warned. How to explain it?</description>

Given the shortage of workers in other age cohorts, more teens are working now than they have since the 2008–09 financial crisis. Even after dangling a $2,500 cash incentive, the city can’t find enough staff.

  <title>Mona Lisa smeared with cake in apparent climate protest</title>

Good news is that Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, probably the most recognizable painting in the world, was not damaged by the caking. A man who disguised himself as an elderly woman in a wheelchair smeared cake on the iconic painting’s glass case at the Louvre yesterday in what appeared to be a climate protest. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe “Mona Lisa” is protected by bulletproof glass, and yesterday we found out that it’s properly shielded against cake, too. Big picture: Something about the “Mona Lisa” gets people riled up, and yesterday’s attack was not the first time the portrait’s been messed with…It was stolen by three Italian handymen in 1911, which actually helped boost its status.</description>

In fact, one of the ways I would look to utilize this mentor is to gain access to the people that they know. The key to figuring out how to utilize a mentor starts with understanding a mentor’s purpose. In order to best utilize your mentor, you’ll want to 1) make sure they know what problems you’re running into 2) have some level of visibility into your work and 3) have insight into your short- and long-term goals. Most were not officially assigned and, sadly, none were actually named Mentor.</description>

More generally, many interviewers are trying too hard to look for people who are a lot like them. To help us become better talent spotters in a world where spotting talent is increasingly important, economist Tyler Cowen and venture capitalist and entrepreneur Daniel Gross wrote a book on the art and science of finding talent at the highest level.
