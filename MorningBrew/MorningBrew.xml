  <title>US Regulatory Panel Questions AstraZeneca Vaccine Results</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4476%2Fastrazeneca.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wee hours of Tuesday morning, when nothing good ever happens, a panel that oversees US clinical trial safety said AstraZeneca's vaccine results may include "outdated and potentially misleading" data. Big picture: Vaccine hesitancy, in the US and abroad, started out higher than public health officials wanted. Add this to the growing listWhile AstraZeneca's vaccine has been approved in 70+ countries, the rollout has faced Galaxy Note 7-level challenges.  The statement arrived hours after the drugmaker announced its two-shot vaccine was 79% effective in US trials.</description>

  <title>News Outlets Adjust to Life After Trump</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4473%2Fold_news.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A few months into the new Biden administration, news consumption has significantly declined, according to the Washington Post. If you haven’t felt the itch to check Twitter 24/7, skim your preferred news site, or keep cable news humming in the background since President Trump left office, join the club. Politics consumption on major new sites dropped 28% from January to February, according to analytics company SimilarWeb, but interest in business and finance news only slightly declined over the same period.    The Washington Post is going the opposite route.</description>

Throw in the onset of a global pandemic, more efficient ways of receiving news (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn), and door-busting subscription deals, and conditions were ripe for news outlets to thrive.  TV: CNN lost almost half of its primetime viewership in the key 25–54 demographic in the period between President Biden's inauguration and March 15.</description>

  <title>What's the Hype Around Air Fryers?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4440%2Fair_fryer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A few years later, van der Weij licensed the tech to Philips, which debuted the first modern air fryer at a consumer electronics show in Berlin in 2010.  But what is an air fryer? But here’s where the genius of van der Weij comes in: Air fryers get your food nice and crispy without the oil bath. The recommendation site Wirecutter put the air fryer on its “Worst Things for Most People” list. Basically, an air fryer pummels your food with hot air circulated by a high-speed fan. The pandemic, and the millions of new home chefs it spawned, may have anointed the air fryer kitchen royalty. You encounter the Maillard reaction when you eat all kinds of delicious foods, including campfire-roasted marshmallows, seared steaks, and french fries.</description>

  <title>Supply Chains Need a Factory Reset </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4430%2Ftopshot-china-health-viru.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bottom line: There isn't one primary driver of supply chain chaos—it's simply a series of unfortunate events. Demand for lumber by home builders has outstripped supply to the point where prices have shot up more than 180% since last spring. How about a wood shortage.  Got room for one more?</description>
