  <title>Full Vaccine Approval for Pfizer Is Expected as Soon as Today</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6351%2Fpfizer_covid-19_vaccine_d.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Full approval will likely lead to more vaccine requirements among organizations and businesses, and, officials hope, will build more confidence among skeptical Americans to get the shot voluntarily. the next vaccine to be considered for full approval is Moderna’s, which could come a few weeks after Pfizer’s green light. The FDA could grant full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine as soon as today, according to the NYT.  More manufacturing scrutiny: Full approval requires more inspections of facilities, and vaccine makers to provide more detailed production info, per Marks.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How to Ask for the Raise You Deserve</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Not only is it reasonable—and decidedly not insensitive, greedy, or insulting—to ask that your employer consider the fair value of your contributions, but most managers would prefer a little candor now over an unexpected resignation later from an employee they may never have known was feeling undervalued. While it’s fine to acknowledge that times are hard, there will always be a reason for your employer not to show you the money (don’t recommend this approach, btw).   Instead, focus on the great things you are doing to add value and the measurable outcomes of your work (especially those that underpin key financial metrics) by tying your deliverables to the goals and objectives of the business wherever possible.</description>

  <title>The Great Havana Syndrome Mystery</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6335%2Fu_s_embassy_at_focus_of.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This summer, at least two US officials at the US Embassy in Germany felt so sick they couldn’t work. In the years since, reported Havana syndrome cases among US foreign officers have popped up in Moscow, China, London, Virginia, and, most recently, Vienna and Germany.  One recent victim, who was working at a US embassy in Europe, told the WSJ it was “striking” that some people hit with the attacks were working on Russia-related issues.  Turns out, they were suffering from an illness experienced by dozens of US diplomats and intelligence officers around the globe in recent years: Havana Syndrome.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...E-Commerce Mogul Marc Lore</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6328%2Fmarc_lore.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What is a fact that most people don’t know about you? When you have an idea for a business there always seems to be concern about telling too many people out of fear that someone will steal it. It doesn’t work like that.  What will be the most disruptive force in e-commerce in the next 10 years? Land appreciation is caused by primarily two things: First is when people build communities, other people want to join those communities and live in those locations. Share your idea with as many people as possible.  In the future buying something will be like having your own personal Jarvis. Sharing ideas with as many people as possible will help you shape your vision, plus it will help you recruit people. Having a really strong Chief People Officer can help set the culture and values and bring in the very best, most diverse talent. And now in the startups that I’m creating today, the Chief People Officer is typically the first hire, because people are the most important asset within a company. People will tell you it doesn’t make sense and why it won’t work. And it’s about being more equitable and giving citizens an ownership stake and, as the city does better, the residents do better. That was fun and interesting, but more interesting was that they were going to take the fastest time of the week and send the person to the US national team training camp.   It seems to me that the fair way to do it would be for all this land appreciation—appreciation caused by the people within the city—to benefit those citizens and come back to them. At the end of the month there were tryouts and the top 13 would make the US national team.</description>

Crypto is getting hotter and hotterThe current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has soared to about $2 trillion¹; bitcoin alone is at around $850 billion.  Bottom line: Crypto is no longer niche. These trends help show that investors think crypto is a good place to park their money, even if governments are just making moves to regulate it now. is basically just the world these days. ²In April, crypto exchange Coinbase went public at a valuation of about $85 billion, showing there’s quite a bit of appetite for access to cryptos. You can also pay with bitcoin when you order the latest paperback plus some dish soap on Amazon. The water’s warm, and with Bakkt, you can swan-dive in, free of transaction fees and with as little as $10. But because of fractional coins and investment tools like futures and ETFs, you can invest as little as $5 in cryptocurrency.</description>

  <title>How to Buy Bitcoin...Without Buying Bitcoin</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3997%2Fbitcoin_tesla.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is a publicly traded, SEC-reporting company that you can invest in through your normal brokerages, making it more accessible to traders who are less comfortable navigating other avenues for acquiring bitcoin. Invest in companies that hold bitcoin on their balance sheetsOn August 11, 2020, business intelligence firm MicroStrategy became the first publicly traded company to allocate a portion of its cash holdings into bitcoin.  Now, many of them are publicly traded companies that you can also invest in. Invest in crypto trading platforms As cryptocurrencies have risen to prominence over the last decade, so too have companies that offer a safe and secure way to buy and sell the digital assets. The cards listed below each give you a small amount of bitcoin every time you swipe. Invest in blockchain ETFsA relatively recent development in the crypto space is the rise of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that offer exposure to bitcoin and other blockchain-based companies. One is made up of bitcoin and the other ethereum, which are the two largest cryptocurrencies. Since then, higher profile companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets, most notably Tesla, leading to more opportunities for investors to get their toes wet without diving all the way into the crypto deep end.</description>

  <title>Let the Pandemic Take Office Dress Codes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/geXJ0CoZr9PyM/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“ Most straight-sized folks can go out to a store and just buy clothing or can go thrift a lot of their professional attire,” they said. Melinda, a new teacher who asked to be identified by only their first name, spent $600+ when they switched schools after their first year of teaching and had to match a new school’s muddy “business professional” dress code. Business casual is a dress code so ill-defined that the best way to describe it is to say what it isn’t. Dress codes create financial barriers for young people, support bias in the workplace, and cause more problems that bleed over into our everyday lives, even after the end of the work day. At one point, I even got a comment from my office manager asking if I had already worn one of those three shirts earlier that week,” he said. Her job is asking employees to come back into the office, and when she tried to bring up her financial concerns about purchasing new office clothes, she was met with congratulations on her weight loss. For the last year-and-a-half, most office workers have been working from home in, at their fanciest, a stain-free shirt for meetings. Dress codes create a barrierThis confusion can be frustrating and expensive for young people entering the workforce.  And for many young professionals, there’s a serious disconnect between dress codes and pay. brands might be seeing the error of their ways. Emily Milligan, a recent grad, told Morning Brew that after getting a competitive unpaid internship with their state’s attorney general, they had to buy an entire suit. The good news: Business casual and its precious lil $50 flowy-sleeved blouses are already on their way out. Before we do, let’s officially retire office dress codes.</description>
