  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/933/home_office.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  A Morning Brew/Harris poll conducted last weekend found that… Two-thirds (67%) of remote workers say their lifestyle has gotten healthier since working from home. About the same amount (38%) say they've been taking time to cook their meals.

  <title>Facebook and Google Extend Their Broad Sweeping Bans on Political Ads</title>

Much like we had planned to always wear pants while working, Facebook and Google had planned to lift their bans on political advertising one week after the election concluded.  </description>

  <title>Sony and Microsoft Take Different Approaches in Their Latest Console War</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/V6Y9IpDepemUB9IWbd/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the launch of the Sony PlayStation 5 today and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S on Tuesday, this week marks harmonic convergence of the console giants all over again—an endless cycle of hyped hardware releases that occurs every eight-ish years. Sony continues to be the hardware leader for die-hard gamers. P.S. Neither Sony nor Microsoft is expected to sell the most consoles this holiday season. A new offering called “All Access” lets gamers pay for the new Xbox in monthly installments, and—here’s the kicker—also signs them up for Xbox’s Netflix-like Game Pass Ultimate gaming subscription service.</description>

  <title>New Study Indicates Crowded Indoor Spaces Are Ripe for Covid Transmission</title>

Not only were they less likely to work from home, but also the indoor venues they visited were more crowded.   Quick note on methodology: Using anonymized smartphone data, the researchers tracked the movements of 98 million people in 10 U.S. metros from March to May—the first wave of the virus.</description>

Yesterday morning, Pfizer said its Covid-19 vaccine was over 90% effective in late-stage clinical trials.   Next steps The FDA needs follow-up data to make sure Pfizer's vaccine isn't making participants grow tails.   If it gets it, Pfizer says it can produce 50 million doses by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion in 2021.   We don't know if the vaccine prevents asymptomatic transmission or severe Covid cases that cause hospitalization. And an effective vaccine can't come fast enough. Pfizer's product is harder to move around than an octopus ice sculpture.</description>
