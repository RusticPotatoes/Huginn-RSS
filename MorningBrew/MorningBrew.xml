  <title>Money Matters: Getting the Right Mix</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ixZmwZC0R1Zi87EOqG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How much money should I be investing and saving in cash every month? Keep enough cash to cover three to six months of expenses in a savings account that you can tap in the face of financial hardship. But cash comes first. Perhaps only Elon Musk appears in this newsletter as much as inflation, which is just one reason not to hoard more cash than is necessary.</description>

  <title>Jerome Powell's Future as Fed Chair Is Uncertain</title>

Should Powell get another four years?  Why you should care: The Fed Chair is the world’s most powerful economic policymaker. Around Labor Day, President Biden is expected to decide whether to keep Powell in the role after his four-year term expires in February.  But Powell has plenty of critics, too.</description>

  <title>How a Blockchain Expert Fights Crypto Crime</title>

It wasn't invented by cryptocurrency people. There was I think almost 400% growth in ransomware attacks, 350% growth, and this year is on track to outpace last year already. I think that's one thing that’s going to play out over the next year. Each type of crime is very, very different. I was reading the SEC’s red flags for investors and almost every single one of them applies to cryptocurrency. The victims of ransomware attacks are mostly businesses; increasingly, we're seeing that the victims of ransomware are big businesses, where you might have a more sophisticated attack vector so you can ask for more money. If you send ransom to a wallet, you actually have a shot at getting it back because we can follow where the money goes. We're able to let people know if they're accepting money from a darknet marketplace. And the theory is that they actually fake their own death in order to run away with the stolen funds. And then I learned while I was doing some research on this case that there's this whole faking-your-death industry in cryptocurrency. Has any type of illicit cryptocurrency activity noticeably grown in the past year? Do you have any predictions for the landscape of illicit cryptocurrency activity? Like, the Ponzi scheme actually works in almost exactly the same way.  If you can't find information about who the people really are and there's no incorporation info, who would you be able to go to if you weren't able to access your funds?   Ransomware is something that the government is extremely interested in right now. But the benefit of cryptocurrency is that there's a recourse to these attacks. And then we have a bunch of other ransomware hacks or stolen funds, sanctioned addresses, terrorist financing, and fraud shops (a type of darknet marketplace that only sells illicit goods). An exchange was hacked, but then it was speculated that the person actually faked their own death. We found this drug smuggling group based out of Australia who were importing drugs from the UK, and what they would do was purchase really fancy furniture from Harrods.</description>
