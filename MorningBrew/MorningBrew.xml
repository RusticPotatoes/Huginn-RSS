  <title>The Summer Movie Season Kicks Off</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5180%2Fvin_diesel.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After a debacle of a year in 2020 due to the pandemic, the lucrative summer movie season unofficially kicks off this year with A Quiet Place Part II and Cruella, which will hit US theaters Memorial Day weekend.   When F9 hits the US box office on June 25 its performance, plus the success of the previously mentioned blockbusters, will help us learn more about the state of the theater industry. At least that’s what the movie theater industry is hoping. Last summer, theaters grossed $176 million, a 96% decrease from 2019.</description>

It runs through everything from national and local factors that precipitated the event to the massacre itself to the aftermath. Go deeper on what happened May 31 and June 1Read: In 1921, journalist Walter White, who would later become the NAACP director, was sent to Tulsa to write about what happened for The Nation.  ABC’s Soul of a Nation shares the stories of survivors and looks at how the city is still working to heal those wounds.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Recruiting Takeover </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you apply and are asked about your current company/role, my suggestion would be to reference notable companies, brands, or clients you work with along with the less-recognizable name of the smaller company you work for. is a question I get asked in every interview.  You can always check the Glassdoor profile of a company you’re applying to, but take it with a grain of salt since reviews on there can sometimes be really old. Everyone says working for a small company/startup leads to valuable skills, but many recruiters may not recognize the company's name.</description>
