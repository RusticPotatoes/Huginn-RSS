  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1607%2Finstagram_on_puase_influencers.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, a group of 44 attorneys general asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to ditch plans to develop an Instagram platform for children younger than 13, the current age cutoff for FB services.

  <title>Will Crypto Rule the World?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5044%2Fcrypto_future.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The world is truly crypto’s oyster. And while we don’t recommend a doge tat, we do recommend boning up on crypto, even knowing how volatile it is. Not only have cryptos checked that box, they’ve become major players in the $$$ world—aka finance.  And you’ve probably heard a thing or two about NFTs, a blockchain-based way to claim exclusive ownership of a piece of art, video clip, GIF, or even a newspaper column. The promise of DeFi is a financial system that’s more efficient, more tech-driven, and—dare we say it? decentralized finance, or DeFi. Why are those people so hyped? The idea of DeFi is pretty revolutionary.</description>
