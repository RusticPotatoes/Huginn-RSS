  <title>Senate Prepares for Stimulus Vote</title>

Now that the wage increase is out, a handful of moderate Democrats who were skeptical of it are more likely to support the bill. If it passes, the House will need to vote again on a matching version.   </description>

  <title>Buy-Now-Pay-Later Giant Klarna Worth $31B After Latest Round of Funding</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4222%2Fklarna.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the BNPL hype? Companies like Macy's and Neiman Marcus still rely heavily on store- and co-branded credit card fees to pad their bottom lines, offerings that compete with BNPL options.  One of the earliest companies to the BNPL game, Klarna offers consumers the option to pay for an item online in installments rather than all at once.  But BNPL has put retail giants in a pickle.  That concerns regulators, since more than than 10% of customers at one bank that had used BNPL were already behind on their payments, according to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett Releases Annual Shareholder Letter and Berkshire Hathaway Earnings</title>

Berkshire also bought back almost $25 billion of its own stock last year, reducing the total number of outstanding shares and increasing current investors’ ownership.  Looking ahead...  But notice what isn’t there: the pandemic, racial justice protests, the election, GameStop, and crypto. “There has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America.”</description>

Khashoggi’s killing drew outrage from the international media and US lawmakers, and investigations zeroed in on the role of Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the 35-year-old de facto ruler of the kingdom.   </description>

  <title>Why Does Every Streaming Service Have a Plus Sign?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4191%2Fparamount_plus.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some industry analysts think that streaming services may be in a better position for the long-term if they can resist adding the plus sign.  Off the top of my head I can count Discovery+, Disney+, ESPN+, Apple TV+, BET+, and AMC+. we may not have another streaming service with a + for a while, because we may not even have a new streaming service for a while.  "Our research confirmed that the plus sign has become synonymous with streaming video on demand services," David Leavy, chief operating officer for Discovery, told the LA Times. As CNBC notes, Paramount+ is the last of the big streaming unveils that started with Apple TV+ in March 2019.</description>
