  <title>How to Get Morning Brew Swag for Free</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2962/referral_cycle.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Before we start, you can find your unique referral link at the bottom of the Brew each day.   Here are 6 strategies for racking up referrals and getting free Brew swag just in time for the holidays. That’s because when you hit certain referral milestones, we’ll send you Morning Brew swag, like a mug or even a sweatshirt.   To a copywriter named Rob Allen, the undisputed king of Brew referrals with well over 3,000 to his name, Quora is a nonstop referral generator.   2. Do what this guy did   Giphy  To most people, Quora is just a popular site people visit to ask questions and find answers to every subject under the sun. But using your group chats to sign people up for the Brew can actually be a referral magnet.   You can read Rob’s blog post about his referral conquest here, but the short version goes like this: he identified a commonly asked question about the stock market, answered it intelligently, added his referral link at the bottom of his answer, then watched the referrals pour in as his post earned over 180,000 page views.   6.   5.   4.   1. Let the Brew sell itself. Do what Alex and Austin did   Sara Hillstrom The cofounders of the Brew know a thing or three about getting email signups.   Once people have taken the bait and interacted with the screenshot (or even if they haven’t), hit them with a follow-up text saying “Btw, if you want to sign up for the Brew, here’s the link.”   And if you get in trouble...</description>

  <title>Texas's Economic Makeover Will Make Election Day Interesting</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/8FPgfXhHCmy2wOCGGH/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  What it means for Election Day Data compiled by the University of Houston shows that Texas's major metropolitan areas now account for 69% of the statewide vote, up from 52% in 1968.   Bottom line: It would still take a historic upswell of Democratic support to flip the state in this election.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2925/mean_girls.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  14-day quarantines were reduced to seven days in France, while Belgium, Spain, and Germany are cutting them to 10.   Canada, Thailand, and the U.S. are also considering chopping quarantines for international visitors.

  <title>5 and a 1/2 Steps for Fact Checking Your Social Media Feed</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieNLnAxzZI9CQzm/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Disneyland2go on Twitter To make sure an account is legit, you can do a cursory scroll for red flags to see if any official websites link to it. It’s best to find the original post and fact check that instead.   You can also fact check an image using techniques from Step 2 and 3: Use Google to research the photo’s background (who’s in it, what’s happening) or look it up on fact-checking sites like Snopes.   The following websites are useful resources to quickly make sure a fact checks out: AP Fact Check and FactCheck are dedicated to verifying/debunking claims, while Snopes specifically tackles viral social media news.   Step 2: Check your source Ask: Who posted this content?   So when you feel extremely emotional about a post, rein in your urge to click, and continue your fact check.   If a visualization seems suspicious for any of the above reasons, or if it’s just too crazy to be true, you can reverse image search the same way you would any other image. Is the data all from one source, or multiple? 🚩: Stats, graphs, and charts that tug violently at your emotions    Data is Ugly on Reddit Do: Make sure any charts you’re looking at are set up in a way that isn’t misleading, like the one above.   Many doctored images fit a pattern.   The Media Manipulation Casebook is like its own degree in fact-checking. 🚩 Famous people doing things that feel out of character; any text on the image (especially on a white background); no photographer/website credited   archive.   Case study: You don’t need to be a pro YouTuber to create viral fake news. Even if the people behind the account are who they say they are, it’s important to check that they are who you think they are.   Detecting deepfakes is so complicated that our recommendation really is just to be skeptical and check everything else you can in the post.   Netflix’s The Social Dilemma is a good doc for learning more about algorithms. If Uber posts about Prop 22 (a ballot measure that directly impacts their business), it’s best to check another, independent source like a local newspaper. Step 4a: Verify the image Ask: When was this image taken? One of the best ways to debunk a fake photo like this one is to reverse image search it on Google.   As we barrel roll toward the election, the news you read on social media won’t just affect your vote, but liking or sharing it could send posts spiraling into the East Australian Current that is going viral.   Facebook has been taken to court for the misinformation spread like peanut butter across its platforms, while Twitter’s war on fake news has led to many dustups with POTUS—most recently over a blocked New York Post article about Joe Biden.   If the source is shady or the post takes you on that emotional roller coaster I mentioned earlier, take it with a grain of salt or go into full fact-checking mode.   Go Deeper Read between the lines by learning how to spot logical fallacies.</description>

  <title>Social Media Platforms Have Prepared for a Confusing Election Day</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3012/crazy_day_on_social_media.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The run-up   Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent bouts with fake news have forced social media execs to enact new policies targeting misinformation, election interference, and conspiracy theories.   Advertising: Last fall, Twitter and TikTok banned all political ads. In 2020, social media platforms have become a go-to source for election information—and misinformation. Platforms have expanded their arsenals this election cycle to help voters through a confusing time. Slowing virality: Twitter added extra friction to retweets, and Facebook and Instagram are lightly pressing the brake on viral content this week. Think twice about sharing and use the Brew's guide to fact checking social media.</description>

  <title>Why Europe Locked Down—Again</title>

German restaurants, bars, gyms, concert halls, and theaters will close starting Nov. 2.</description>

  <title>The Perfect Investment Does Not Exist</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2958/primary.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investing in the stock market can feel that way, too.   The market will always ebb and flow, but if you take a long term approach to investing with money you can afford to let sit and grow, the best time to start is still ASAP. Then use your time to stay informed on certain sectors, read up on quarterly earnings reports of big companies, and earmark that cash to invest the next time there’s a market downturn. The idea of perfect timing doesn’t apply to smart investing—leave that to boarding escalators and planning the perfect proposal. It’s human nature to plan for the perfect moment—be it proposing to your partner on a beach with an airplane banner, or landing the perfect step on an escalator at the mall.</description>

  <title>Big Tech Reports Big Tech Earnings</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/1823/big_tech_under_the_antitrust_spotlight.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Apple posted strong numbers for its fiscal Q4 that modestly beat expectations, with Macs and AirPods offsetting weaker iPhone sales.   The context: Apple has worked on shoring up its software and services, plus it’s boosted products like AirPods and the Apple Watch.   Facebook beat expectations on both revenue ($21.5 billion) and daily active users (1.8+ billion, up 12% yearly). After the bell yesterday, four Big Tech bigwigs dispatched earnings reports.   Google parent Alphabet also reported blowout earnings, with profits at $11.2 billion and revenue at $46 billion last quarter.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2990/spirit_halloween_store.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last year, sales per store declined nearly 21% annually—a major problem for parent Party City considering Halloween sales account for a fifth of its total U.S. retail revenue.

  <title>How to Sell a Haunted House</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2991/halloween_haunted_house.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  So how do you sell a haunted house?   That seems to be the exception to rule, because haunted houses are typically not an easy sell. Both Lynnewood Hall (dubbed the world's largest haunted house) in Elkins Park, PA, and the house from The Silence of the Lambs are on the market. Depends on the state  In New York, if the seller has "claimed to the public at large" that the house is haunted, he or she must disclose the spooky status to buyers.   Believe it or not, hauntedness is a legal designation in the real estate industry.</description>

  <title>The Historical Performance of the Stock Market Based on Presidential Party</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/931/stock_exchange.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  What does that mean for stocks?   Regardless of party, the S&amp;P performs better in a president’s first term than in the second.   Stocks have typically gained more when either party holds a simple majority in the Senate—not more than 60 of the 100 seats.   Bank of America Global Research analyzed historic S&amp;P performance under presidents from both parties.   Investors wish they could take a long weekend in Aruba, but in 2020 there’s no such thing: Tomorrow is Election Day, which will determine what party holds power in D.C. for the next few years.</description>

  <title>Social Media Platforms Have Prepared for a Confusing Election Day</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3012/crazy_day_on_social_media.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The run-up   Russian interference in the 2016 election and subsequent bouts with fake news have forced social media execs to enact new policies targeting misinformation, election interference, and conspiracy theories.   Advertising: Last fall, Twitter and TikTok banned all political ads. In 2020, social media platforms have become a go-to source for election information—and misinformation. Platforms have expanded their arsenals this election cycle to help voters through a confusing time. Slowing virality: Twitter added extra friction to retweets, and Facebook and Instagram are lightly pressing the brake on viral content this week. Think twice about sharing and use the Brew's guide to fact checking social media.</description>

  <title>Q3 2020 Recap</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Jl4M6CA3Id6Op5SXRD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional golf has been underway for months with only minor testing headaches, while the pandemic-era versions of the Tour de France, the U.S. Open in tennis, and the Kentucky Derby went off smoothly. If the first two quarters of the year meant us coming to terms with a global pandemic, Q3 saw us settling into a ~new normal~ of face masks, parking lot dining, and saying "whoops, sorry!"   So what about K-12?   Q3 was the busiest for public offerings since the dot-com era.   That was a lot.   The election, for one.   Over the last three months, extreme weather events made more intense and frequent by human-induced climate change have ravaged communities across the country. There's actually good news.   Pulse check on the economic recovery  It's...   So why are biz leaders wearing out DocuSign?   Looking ahead On the monetary side...   On the corporate side...   On the fiscal side...   Looking ahead... School Reopenings Test Students, College Towns, and Parents After schools across the country closed their doors in the spring, John Krasinski hosted virtual prom, graduation ceremonies were streamed online, and at least one student accidentally said, “Sup, b****?”   Soccer: A  This summer, the National Women's Soccer League became the first major U.S. sports league to return to action from the Covid break, while the MLS has already welcomed fans back in certain states.    How the Economic Recovery Fared in Q3 As the ink dries on Q3, nearly 900,000 Americans are filing new jobless claims each week.   The Atlantic Coast produced so many big tropical storms that the World Meteorological Organization depleted its list of 21 names by September and is now using the Greek alphabet. Even where students can attend school, many parents have chosen not to enroll them. University of Iowa students angered Twitter (an easy feat, really) by lining up for downtown bars in Iowa City, which earlier this month had the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases per capita in the U.S. But for local businesses like The Airliner bar, students returning to campus is their only lifeline—revenue was $0 in April.   Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Parts of the West Coast have been ablaze since August, with a record 3.7 million acres burned across California. Climate change is no longer one of those problems. the M&amp;A could keep flowing, but experts think the IPO frenzy will settle by late October.   Whether you want to relive summer 2020 or would rather pretend it never happened, we present: the Brew's third quarter recap. Basketball: A+  Zero NBA players have tested positive for Covid-19 since entering the famous "bubble" in Orlando. The Tampa Bay Rays, the Brew’s July pick to win it all, entered the postseason as the top team in the American League. But with the election and a Supreme Court fight ahead, don't hold your breath for more emergency aid until the Christmas lights come out.</description>
