  <title>Congress Passes $900B Stimulus Bill</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3452/stimulus.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Payroll Protection Program will get another $285 billion. It’ll bring back extra federal unemployment benefits ($300/week) and one-time $600 payments for millions of Americans, but tucked into the $900 billion package are some big benefits for businesses, too. More than $35 billion will go to energy R&amp;D and the extensions of tax credits for solar and wind projects. The bill has set aside $15 billion for the airline industry; $10 billion for highways; $16 billion for transit and city buses; $2 billion for airports; and $1 billion for Uncle Joe-beloved Amtrak.</description>

To spice things up I said my favorite drink was Mountain Dew... “Did a virtual date for the first time. The call ended about 5 minutes later when I told her I can't date a liar.” she didn't bat an eye and proceeded to tell me she doesn't really drink soda.

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3471/masked_man_with_flowers.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  So what does a pandemic date look like?   Bottom line: “The dating game in COVID is all screen and no scene,” said Harris Poll CEO John Gerzema.

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3449/balmuda_toaster.jpeg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bottom line: There wasn't a market for high-end toasters until Balmuda showed what was possible.
