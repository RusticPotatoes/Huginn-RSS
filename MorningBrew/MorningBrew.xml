  <title>The Trial Between Epic Games and Apple Is Over</title>

Cook also argued that Apple does not closely track the App Store’s profit and loss; in other words, the company’s bean-counting doesn’t interfere with the App Store’s integrity as a marketplace for users to discover apps.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Recruiting Takeover </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you apply and are asked about your current company/role, my suggestion would be to reference notable companies, brands, or clients you work with along with the less-recognizable name of the smaller company you work for. is a question I get asked in every interview.  You can always check the Glassdoor profile of a company you’re applying to, but take it with a grain of salt since reviews on there can sometimes be really old. Everyone says working for a small company/startup leads to valuable skills, but many recruiters may not recognize the company's name.</description>

  <title>How to Not Get (Totally) Ripped Off When Ordering Wine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5174%2Fwine_glass.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They analyzed the prices of 6,335 wines at 249 London restaurants to understand how wine markups at restaurants really work. And for the rest of us who order the average-priced wine of the list... Much has been said about the pitfalls of ordering the second-cheapest bottle of wine on a menu.  What they found: People who order the second-cheapest bottle of wine are in fact not being ripped off more than anyone else. The wines in the middle of the menu, the Pittsburgh Pirates of the wine world, have the highest percentage markup. You pick up the wine men—er, scan the QR code to pull up the wine list.   So how are wine menus priced?</description>

Yesterday, shares in Oatly, the world's biggest oat milk maker, soared 19% in its IPO, valuing the company at a trenta-sized $12 billion. In the oat department alone, Oatly's got competition from Califia Farms, Chobani, Planet Oat, Pacific, and Danone's legacy alternative milk brands, Alpro and Silk. oat milk? But oat milk is still second fiddle to almond milk. Their bet is paying off.</description>

  <title>In finance, 'people of color are shut out before they ever get in'</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5144%2Fblack_businesswoman.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There just aren't that many people of color in finance, even in New York City. Now we in finance are starting to pay attention to diversity. There are more of us now—maybe because banks realized sitting in a room with only 15 white men was a bad look. People of color are shut out before they ever get in. Do I talk to the seven people of color who work in finance? It's just you, the only woman on the floor and one of the few people of color on the floor. When Wells Fargo's CEO says he can't find qualified people of color when I personally have them reaching out to me on LinkedIn every day? I had friends of color from college who happened to be in the finance industry In speaking to my friends of color in different parts of the finance industry, our experiences were analogous. I think the finance industry wants to change. Maybe there aren't seven Black people anymore, but eight. You feel like you work harder than your coworkers with no recognition." I had a friend of color in my cohort and we were among the only people who got the job based on our interviews and credentials, and not who our family was, or who knew someone. We're hardly giving those same chances to people of color. Just to get me in the stadium, essentially. It's so hard to get your foot in the door. You're not seeing the fruits of your labor. In 2015 I received a new manager who happened to be a white man. Sure, there were one or two other Black men, but trying to fit into the culture—the culture of white people, to be frank—was difficult. There was one woman at my bank, more senior, who I could talk to as a kind of mentor. You can see the change particularly when there are industry happy hours and events. But it can be a hard few months or years. I don't know. I'm sure my story is not unique for people of color in finance.</description>

In the oat department alone, Oatly's got competition from Califia Farms, Chobani, Planet Oat, Pacific, and Danone's legacy alternative milk brands, Alpro and Silk. oat milk? But the company didn't become a household name until Petersson took over as CEO in 2014, refreshing Oatly's visual identity and reframing the company’s marketing around oat milk's health and environmental benefits.   But oat milk is still second fiddle to almond milk. Their bet is paying off.</description>

  <title>Why Banking With Greenwood Is About More Than the Money</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5135%2Fgreenwood.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March, Greenwood raised a $40 million Series A from Truist Bank, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase, and most recently, Greenwood partnered with Mastercard to create its first debit card and other educational resources for customers. Greenwood Financial’s founders were inspired by the prosperity of the Greenwood District. Greenwood’s fully digital platform allows people to bank with them from all over the country, specifically in areas that have been shunned by traditional banks, known as bank deserts. But it’s not just about making Greenwood’s services accessible; its users have to trust it, which means reframing the fraught relationship between the US financial institutions and Black Americans. And Greenwood, we're making the Black version of that movie.” As of last June, only 0.2% of all banks regulated by the FDIC were Black-owned, and the number of Black-owned banks has been cut in half since 2001. In the early 1900s, the Greenwood District of Tusla, Oklahoma—often referred to as Black Wall Street—was home to a thriving Black business community.  “You can get Apple Pay and Google Pay, you can get a savings account, a spending account, and you can go to the ATM. The digital banking platform is designed specifically for Black and Latino customers who have historically been denied access to credit and other financial services at much higher rates than white customers. Giddins mentions Italian-American Amadeo Giannini who founded Bank of America, at the time called “Bank of Italy,” in 1904 as a way to provide loans to immigrants who were denied by major financial institutions.</description>
