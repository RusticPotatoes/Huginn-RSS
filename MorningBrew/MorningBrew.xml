  <title>The First Fully Digital, NFT Artwork is Headed to Auction</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4171%2Fbeeple_art.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NFT couldn’t ask for a more legitimizing momentWhile NFTs can arguably be traced back to 2012, they didn’t hit the mainstream until 2017 with blockchain-based CryptoKitties. Check out our NFT FAQ here.  On the auction block: A digital collage of the first 5,000 other-worldy images from Beeple’s “everyday” series, in which Winkelmann has created a new piece of digital art every day for over 10 years. It will be the first fully digital, NFT-based artwork ever sold by a major auction house, and the first to accept cryptocurrency (Ether, specifically) as a payment option. Last December, a collection of 20 Beeple pieces sold for $3.5 million on another NFT platform, Nifty Gateway.</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Style Blog, No. 8: How to Kill Your Darlings</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FTXRHoV5Dvv7cA%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Maybe that reads a little blunt.  Then, you can go through the process described in No. 1; if the draft you write to your college roommate Dan feels too casual, you can zhuzh it up. That’s why editors are essential And I’m not just saying that because it’s review season and my editor decides whether I get a raise. Your best editor can be (and often is) a friend or family member—often, the person who’s most brutally honest about your outfits is your best editor. The magic of a good editor is that she can filter all the unneeded stuff gumming up your sentences without compromising your voice. If you feel it’s too much, you can add back a few fluffy descriptors, or maybe even Jeffrey’s name. And because we love making things way more morbid than they need to be, news folks call the process of removing excess verbiage “killing your darlings,” and sometimes even—sorry—“killing babies.”</description>

  <title>Fans Return to NYC's Basketball Arenas</title>

The backstory: NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo has allowed attendance at arenas provided that fans show a negative PCR Covid-19 test 72 hours before the event starts.</description>

  <title>What Is Market Capitalization?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2334%2Fstocks_declining.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worth noting: Market cap =/= how much it costs to buy a company.  Ask us something else here.  Tesla is the leading EV producer, and legacy automakers and EV startups are largely playing catch up. Brew's answer: Market capitalization, aka "market cap," is a measure of a public company's worth based on the dollar value of outstanding shares.</description>

  <title>Should You Be Worried About Inflation? Short Answer: Probably Not</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Indicators of inflation usually show up in the job market; when it overheats, inflation can start to snowball.    Tech shares in the US and Europe have slumped in anticipation of potential interest rate hikes, a move central banks might make to keep inflation at bay. But many economists say there's no need to worry Including the ones who actually oversee the economy. But the current job market is like the frozen burrito you threw in the microwave—hot on the surface (high yearly wage growth), but icy at the core (elevated unemployment claims).</description>
