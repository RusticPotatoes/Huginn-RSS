  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2996/tv_news.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Bottom line: Don’t tell these networks traditional TV is dead.   A mudslide of early votes. Some tally them as they arrive, but others don’t even start until after polls close.</description>

  <title>The Historical Performance of the Stock Market Based on Presidential Party</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/931/stock_exchange.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  What does that mean for stocks?   Regardless of party, the S&amp;P performs better in a president’s first term than in the second.   Stocks have typically gained more when either party holds a simple majority in the Senate—not more than 60 of the 100 seats.   Bank of America Global Research analyzed historic S&amp;P performance under presidents from both parties.   Investors wish they could take a long weekend in Aruba, but in 2020 there’s no such thing: Tomorrow is Election Day, which will determine what party holds power in D.C. for the next few years.</description>

  <title>How to Sell a Haunted House</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2991/halloween_haunted_house.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  So how do you sell a haunted house?   That seems to be the exception to rule, because haunted houses are typically not an easy sell. Both Lynnewood Hall (dubbed the world's largest haunted house) in Elkins Park, PA, and the house from The Silence of the Lambs are on the market. Depends on the state  In New York, if the seller has "claimed to the public at large" that the house is haunted, he or she must disclose the spooky status to buyers.   Believe it or not, hauntedness is a legal designation in the real estate industry.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/1823/big_tech_under_the_antitrust_spotlight.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Apple posted strong numbers for its fiscal Q4 that modestly beat expectations, with Macs and AirPods offsetting weaker iPhone sales.   The context: Apple has worked on shoring up its software and services, plus it’s boosted products like AirPods and the Apple Watch.   Facebook beat expectations on both revenue ($21.5 billion) and daily active users (1.8+ billion, up 12% yearly). After the bell yesterday, four Big Tech bigwigs dispatched earnings reports.   Google parent Alphabet also reported blowout earnings, with profits at $11.2 billion and revenue at $46 billion last quarter.</description>

  <title>U.S. GDP Rose 7.4% on Quarterly Basis in Q3</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2971/q3_gdp.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, GDP is down 3.5% this year.   On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Q3 GDP rose 7.4%, following a 9% drop in Q2. **Annualized rate: measured as if the economy will continue growing at that pace for a full year. But the third wave of Covid infections and the lack of federal stimulus could be a drag on those numbers.</description>

  <title>Here’s the Deal on Joe Biden and Amtrak</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2887/joe_biden_amtrak.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  But Amtrak always had a fierce defender in Joe Biden Biden protected Amtrak’s subsidies like Walt and Jesse protected each other against slighted kingpins. Throughout his lengthy career as a politician, Biden has associated himself Rachel-and-Monica-closely with train travel, both as a substantive legislative cause and an element of his folksy brand—to the point where some call him Amtrak Joe.  The first time he ran for president, in 1988, Biden launched his campaign from the back of a train.   He claims to have ridden over 2 million miles on 16,000-ish Amtrak trains.     Here’s the deal, folks: Amtrak is an unusual company  In that it’s actually a company/government agency hybrid, like the Postal Service.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/1560/gas_station_green.png'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ESG funds. These inconsistencies have led to awkward groupings, like fossil fuel company ExxonMobil's inclusion in one of BlackRock's ESG funds. Identifying companies rated highly on ESG metrics is an increasingly popular way for investors to deploy their money "responsibly."   What's ESG?</description>

Spain enacted a nightly curfew yesterday and will allow local authorities to restrict regional travel.</description>

  <title>Tough Q3, Covid Outlook Wipe $35B From SAP Market Value</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2915/sap.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SAP was already dealing with some clouds In the last decade, SAP has moved to join its legacy tech peers IBM and Microsoft aboard the cloud computing bandwagon.   The cloud is cannibalizing the software licensing model SAP used to make its big bucks from. SAP who?   Against the backdrop of rising Covid-19 infections, SAP cutting profit targets and hunkering down for a couple more quarters could be a worrying sign for other tech companies. At least you didn't lose $35 billion (we hope). Think you had an unproductive Monday?</description>

  <title>Facebook Tests the Cloud Gaming Waters</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2916/farmville_banner.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Facebook is taking a fundamentally different approach than its rivals, focusing on free games, like the Farmville of yesteryear, that you can play within the Facebook app at your leisure.    Bottom line: While rolling out a completely free-to-use service might not make business sense on the surface, Facebook makes money by keeping users on Facebook.  </description>

  <title>NASA Study Discovers Definitive Presence of Water on the Moon</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/TXa0vDyWB82d2/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NASA had teased a big announcement about the moon for weeks, and yesterday it finally spilled the beans: There is water on the moon.   To clarify, scientists have been hypothesizing about the presence of H2O on the moon since 1971.</description>

  <title>The Vaccine Scene: Where Things Stand As Of Oct. 27</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2920/vaccine_clock.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Big picture: The U.S.’ vaccine game is high-stakes.   FYI, our vaccine is the only one being tested that involves a single dose.   The study hasn’t been peer reviewed yet.   Still, we just barely beat Q3 earnings estimates yesterday.    Pfizer: Optimistic. But if everything goes smoothly, we could turn the tide by July of next year. Any slip-ups in the program—such as only four out of six candidates proving effective, or not enough people getting vaccinated—could mean we’ll be dealing with the virus well into 2023.</description>

  <title>Governments Test Shorter Quarantines to Improve Compliance</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2925/mean_girls.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  14-day quarantines were reduced to seven days in France, while Belgium, Spain, and Germany are cutting them to 10.   Canada, Thailand, and the U.S. are also considering chopping quarantines for international visitors. Which is why a handful of governments are shortening quarantines in hopes that more people will actually start complying, the WSJ reports.</description>

  <title>5 and a 1/2 Steps for Fact Checking Your Social Media Feed</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieNLnAxzZI9CQzm/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Disneyland2go on Twitter To make sure an account is legit, you can do a cursory scroll for red flags to see if any official websites link to it. It’s best to find the original post and fact check that instead.   You can also fact check an image using techniques from Step 2 and 3: Use Google to research the photo’s background (who’s in it, what’s happening) or look it up on fact-checking sites like Snopes.   The following websites are useful resources to quickly make sure a fact checks out: AP Fact Check and FactCheck are dedicated to verifying/debunking claims, while Snopes specifically tackles viral social media news.   Step 2: Check your source Ask: Who posted this content?   So when you feel extremely emotional about a post, rein in your urge to click, and continue your fact check.   If a visualization seems suspicious for any of the above reasons, or if it’s just too crazy to be true, you can reverse image search the same way you would any other image. Is the data all from one source, or multiple? 🚩: Stats, graphs, and charts that tug violently at your emotions    Data is Ugly on Reddit Do: Make sure any charts you’re looking at are set up in a way that isn’t misleading, like the one above.   Many doctored images fit a pattern.   The Media Manipulation Casebook is like its own degree in fact-checking. 🚩 Famous people doing things that feel out of character; any text on the image (especially on a white background); no photographer/website credited   archive.   Case study: You don’t need to be a pro YouTuber to create viral fake news. Even if the people behind the account are who they say they are, it’s important to check that they are who you think they are.   Detecting deepfakes is so complicated that our recommendation really is just to be skeptical and check everything else you can in the post.   Netflix’s The Social Dilemma is a good doc for learning more about algorithms. If Uber posts about Prop 22 (a ballot measure that directly impacts their business), it’s best to check another, independent source like a local newspaper. Step 4a: Verify the image Ask: When was this image taken? One of the best ways to debunk a fake photo like this one is to reverse image search it on Google.   As we barrel roll toward the election, the news you read on social media won’t just affect your vote, but liking or sharing it could send posts spiraling into the East Australian Current that is going viral.   Facebook has been taken to court for the misinformation spread like peanut butter across its platforms, while Twitter’s war on fake news has led to many dustups with POTUS—most recently over a blocked New York Post article about Joe Biden.   If the source is shady or the post takes you on that emotional roller coaster I mentioned earlier, take it with a grain of salt or go into full fact-checking mode.   Go Deeper Read between the lines by learning how to spot logical fallacies.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/8FPgfXhHCmy2wOCGGH/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  What it means for Election Day Data compiled by the University of Houston shows that Texas's major metropolitan areas now account for 69% of the statewide vote, up from 52% in 1968.   Bottom line: It would still take a historic upswell of Democratic support to flip the state in this election.</description>

German restaurants, bars, gyms, concert halls, and theaters will close starting Nov. 2.</description>

  <title>Q3 2020 Recap</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Jl4M6CA3Id6Op5SXRD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional golf has been underway for months with only minor testing headaches, while the pandemic-era versions of the Tour de France, the U.S. Open in tennis, and the Kentucky Derby went off smoothly. If the first two quarters of the year meant us coming to terms with a global pandemic, Q3 saw us settling into a ~new normal~ of face masks, parking lot dining, and saying "whoops, sorry!"   So what about K-12?   Q3 was the busiest for public offerings since the dot-com era.   That was a lot.   The election, for one.   Over the last three months, extreme weather events made more intense and frequent by human-induced climate change have ravaged communities across the country. There's actually good news.   Pulse check on the economic recovery  It's...   So why are biz leaders wearing out DocuSign?   Looking ahead On the monetary side...   On the corporate side...   On the fiscal side...   Looking ahead... School Reopenings Test Students, College Towns, and Parents After schools across the country closed their doors in the spring, John Krasinski hosted virtual prom, graduation ceremonies were streamed online, and at least one student accidentally said, “Sup, b****?”   Soccer: A  This summer, the National Women's Soccer League became the first major U.S. sports league to return to action from the Covid break, while the MLS has already welcomed fans back in certain states.    How the Economic Recovery Fared in Q3 As the ink dries on Q3, nearly 900,000 Americans are filing new jobless claims each week.   The Atlantic Coast produced so many big tropical storms that the World Meteorological Organization depleted its list of 21 names by September and is now using the Greek alphabet. Even where students can attend school, many parents have chosen not to enroll them. University of Iowa students angered Twitter (an easy feat, really) by lining up for downtown bars in Iowa City, which earlier this month had the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases per capita in the U.S. But for local businesses like The Airliner bar, students returning to campus is their only lifeline—revenue was $0 in April.   Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Parts of the West Coast have been ablaze since August, with a record 3.7 million acres burned across California. Climate change is no longer one of those problems. the M&amp;A could keep flowing, but experts think the IPO frenzy will settle by late October.   Whether you want to relive summer 2020 or would rather pretend it never happened, we present: the Brew's third quarter recap. Basketball: A+  Zero NBA players have tested positive for Covid-19 since entering the famous "bubble" in Orlando. The Tampa Bay Rays, the Brew’s July pick to win it all, entered the postseason as the top team in the American League. But with the election and a Supreme Court fight ahead, don't hold your breath for more emergency aid until the Christmas lights come out.</description>
