  <title>Facebook and Biden in War of Words Over Vaccine Misinformation</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5820%2Fgood_will_hunting.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facebook has taken steps to limit the spread of vaccine misinformation—such as removing posts that promote vaccine lies—but the Biden administration thinks those actions have been toothless.   WH Press Secretary Jen Psaki said health misinformation on social media is “leading to people not taking the vaccine, and people are dying as a result.” More than 97% of new hospitalizations from the Delta variant are of people who’ve not been vaccinated, the agency said.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...NFL Legend Ndamukong Suh</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5819%2Fndamukong_suh.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s one of those things where I don't think you need to bet all of your money on one thing, but I do think you need to have exposure to it. I had to ask myself, “How do I understand what a budget is?” I remember back in the day a long snapper named Don Muhlbach was one of the few guys in the locker room I would talk to about finance, where he was at with his business, and who he aspired to be. Four sacks in a playoff game or a Super Bowl win—that’d be the best. Some of them I've already accomplished so that’s probably why I didn’t pick them.  No. 1 draft pick Trevor Lawrence is getting his signing bonus paid out in cryptocurrency.  There’s for sure more conversations on those topics in the locker room compared to 2010 when I first got in the league. I don’t see myself putting my salary fully into bitcoin. If you could own one building what would it be? Now, it’s on Reddit and you see all the news about GameStop so I think it’s seen as more “cool” to talk about it and be in the know.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: How Many Credit Cards Is too Many?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5817%2Fcredit_cards.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credit card rewards can pack a serious punch. —Eduardo from New YorkThe question isn’t how many credit cards you should have, but rather how much of your total credit limit you’re using. If you have just one credit card with a $1,000 limit, stay sub-$300, even when you pay in full and on time. How many credit cards should I have, and is it OK to close one if I never used it and have no balance?</description>

  <title>Biogen's Alzheimer's Drug Continues to Face Backlash More Than a Month After Approval</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ZFzpCzdWotBIdiYoLA/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Thursday, influential hospitals Cleveland Clinic, NYC’s Mount Sinai Health System, and Providence in Washington State said they wouldn’t administer Aduhelm, citing concerns over its effectiveness and safety. the blowback has been so bad that the acting FDA chief has ordered a federal investigation to explore the perhaps too-cozy relationship between the scientists who approved the drug and the drugmaker, Biogen. An Alzheimer’s drug hadn’t been approved by the FDA in 18 years.  Some experts who helped the FDA evaluate Aduhelm protested the decision.  The FDA’s approval of the drug, called Aduhelm, was met with widespread criticism.</description>

  <title>What's Up With the Child Tax Credit?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5777%2Firs_building.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taxpayers who claimed the child tax credit on their 2020 returns—or 2019 for those who haven’t yet filed for 2020—should be all set to receive monthly payments. The monthly max payment is $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. Until then, chat up a tax pro if:Your income increased significantly in 2021You’re concerned about a higher-than-usual tax bill next yearYou take turns with someone in claiming the child tax creditYour child turns 6 or 18 in 2021You’re too late to unenroll from the first payment, but you can discontinue the rest here. Parents who aren’t required to file taxes can sign up for payments on the non-filer portal. You’ll get the max payment when your AGI is below... You’ll get something when your AGI is below:$240,000 and you’re single$440,000 and you’re married filing jointly$240,000 and you’re a head of householdYou can calculate exactly how much you’ll get here. The IRS is looking back at your most recent return to calculate your monthly payment, but the actual tax credit amount is based on your 2021 situation. They’ll get the other half when they file their 2021 taxes next year.</description>
