  <title>How to Write a Cover Letter and Not Hate the Process</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J9O9elEvuRjMyXu/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A cover letter is often the first time a hiring manager gets the chance to “meet” you, so don’t waste it. Always thank people for their time and, while this might be controversial, “best” is the best way to sign off (besides “love,” but unfortunately that’s not appropriate for a job application. Identify the company’s mission, look at the way it talks about itself, and reference it in your cover letter. = I know how to write for a specific audience(I’m a fan of hyperlinking in cover letters and resumes. I can offer a unique perspective coming from the legal sphere, for example, I can help Morning Brew never get sued. Here’s a copy of my cover letter for Morning Brew:“My name is Mattison Merritt and I’m a writer, comedian, and social media manager currently living in Chicago. = I’m good at time managementProve that you did your research“I want to join the Morning Brew team as a writer to help make business news more accessible and engaging.” Maybe humor isn’t the way to go, but adding a little personality to your cover letter can make you stand out. Be funny sometimes, be interesting alwaysI had four clever bits in my cover letter and each of them helped illustrate, but not distract from, the point I was trying to make about myself or my experience. Here are a few lines from my cover letter where I hit the job qualifications without just listing a bunch of buzzwords:“I’ve worked at the American Bar Association for two years now, within the first year I was promoted twice in part because I wanted to create projects that would allow me to research legal topics I was interested in.” So here’s a rundown of how I used my cover letter to land the best job I’ve ever had—besides being a camp counselor, of course.  Here’s one example: “I can offer a unique perspective coming from the legal sphere, for example, I can help Morning Brew never get sued.</description>

  <title>C-corp vs. Pass-through Taxes: What’s the Difference?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For tax purposes, businesses are either pass-through entities or C corporations. You’re taxed on your entire share of business profits, regardless of whether they sit in your business or personal bank account. If you’re paying attention, you might have caught that dividends are taxed twice: once at the entity level and again on our personal tax returns. Business profits are passed through to owners, who pay taxes based on individual tax rates. I’ll owe tax on $40,000, and you’ll owe tax on the remaining $60,000. One of them is how you want your business to be taxed.  Multiple business structures are subject to pass-through taxation. Pass-through entities are businesses that pay income taxes solely on their owners’ individual tax returns. In general, solo entrepreneurs and small businesses opt for pass-through taxation since there’s less paperwork and red tape, while medium and large companies often favor C-corp tax treatment. It’s called a pass-through because the business doesn’t pay an entity-level income tax. And, you can change your business structure or tax status as your business’s needs evolve. On my tax return, I report my $40,000 salary and my share of the dividend, which is $2,000. Let’s see how that works if our phone case business is a C-corp. What is C-corp taxation?  Notice how our tax liabilities don’t take into account how much money we moved from business coffers into our personal bank accounts? C-corps report income and pay taxes on Form 1120.</description>

  <title>Upfront About Newfronts: A Q&amp;A with Tubi Chief Content Officer, Adam Lewinson</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4949%2Ftubi_newfronts.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We just announced that we’ll be launching Tubi Originals with more than 140 hours of content designed specifically with Tubi viewers in mind. As you look at the content and streaming landscape, where do you think the next great innovation will be?  I think not only for 2021, but for next year as well, streaming is poised to take center stage at Upfronts. While we of course highlight the premium content that brings in our viewers and keeps them engaged, we also discuss ways in which Tubi can help maximize a brand’s ability to measure and manage ads—including our Advanced Frequency Management tool which reduces ad repetition, our Certified Measurement Program which helps brands better measure the effectiveness of their advertising spend, and our Content Intelligence which gives brands insights to better inform their campaign creative and targeting. With the largest library of any streaming service—over 30,000 titles and growing—we have a robust collection of movies and TV shows across every genre.   When you think about places where you can innovate better than your peers, what comes to mind?  It’s Upfronts season, and everyone is jockeying for attention. That said, consumers are only willing to pay for so many subscription streaming services, especially as new players have entered the market, so AVOD will likely become a much larger focus of the conversation in the next few years. Two different areas come to mind to me—the first is our ad tech.</description>

With a net worth of about $145 billion, Bill Gates is the fourth-richest person in the world. In a joint statement, Bill and Melinda said they will "continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives." Zoom out: Bill and Melinda are the second Seattle-area power couple to get divorced in recent years. More questions than answers.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger Take on Bitcoin, Robinhood at Annual Meeting</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4933%2Fwarren_buffett_chairman.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Buffett called Apple an “extraordinary business,” and it still remains the company’s largest stock holding. and then there’s Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and his longtime business partner Charlie Munger. Buffett said SPACs have made it even harder for Berkshire to strike a deal at an attractive price. But since the start of the pandemic, the S&amp;P 500 has doubled up Berkshire Hathway’s stock gain, raising concerns that Buffett and Co. are out of touch with the new, tech-driven economy. As for his decision to pull out of the airline sector early in the pandemic, Buffett is perfectly comfortable with that.</description>

Buffett said SPACs have made it even harder for Berkshire to strike a deal at an attractive price.  Robinhood: Buffett said Robinhood’s platform for retail investors was “taking advantage of the gambling instincts of society, and it isn’t admirable.</description>

Does Apple have an illegal monopoly over app distribution?</description>

  <title>Apple’s AirTags Go On Sale</title>

Yesterday, the EU issued antitrust charges against Apple over its App Store practices. And Apple finds your dog differently than Tile does... While Tile finds devices using Bluetooth signals, each AirTag is equipped with an ultra-wideband chip that allows owners to track them down with much more precision than Bluetooth can.  Zoom out: Apple hasn’t commented on the augmented reality possibilities of AirTags.</description>

  <title>Basecamp Joins Coinbase in Banning Social or Political Talk at Work</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2574%2Fworkplace_politics.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You can imagine the conversations on Election Day… Tyler Denk on Twitter After Fried announced Basecamp's new policy, Armstrong tweeted: "Another mission focused company 👏 it takes courage in these times." And we're done with it on our company Basecamp account where the work happens." Zoom out: While they haven't gone as far as Coinbase or Basecamp, other tech companies have put up guardrails around what employees can or cannot talk about in internal chats. Some tech leaders, like Facebook cofounder and current Asana CEO Dustin Moskovitz, said instead of pushing uncomfortable issues to the sidelines, companies should "actively create spaces for these conversations." In 2019, Google discouraged employees from talking politics in company forums.  But very few expected when, on Monday, Fried posted a blog on the company website in which he banned "societal and political discussions" from Basecamp's internal chats.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How Do I Overcome Imposter Syndrome? </title>

Q: How do you know when it’s time to leave a job? How often do you believe this to be true?" If it's because of a lack of skills, I try to do the work to gain those qualifications. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. Often, we talk to ourselves in a way that we wouldn't tolerate from anyone else. Be kind to yourself and work on creating a healthy mental dialogue about any mistakes you make.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Andrew Ross Sorkin</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4914%2Fandrew_ross_sorkin.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I work 80+ hours a week and I've always done it because I love it.  What is the dumbest thing you made your parents buy for you as a kid? I convinced my father, based on my track record of making money trading cards, to invest in a case of Fleer Ultra baseball cards. It isn't that he is intimidating as a person; it is that he is so smart and deep on so many different topics. So I'm going to try to figure out how to do a lot more of my work with my family within reach and to be more strategic about travel, work dinners, etc.  You can only do one: writing for the New York Times, TV anchoring, or producing (co-creating Billions for Showtime, developing a GameStop film for HBO). We still have the cards if anyone wants to buy them.</description>

  <title>Hot Rod Charlie and His Five Best Human Friends Have Big Kentucky Derby Dreams</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4917%2Fhot_rod_charlie.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, as the friends traveled the country over the last year to watch Chuck run and also perhaps enjoy a few beers, they never expected the horse to end up qualifying for the most elite horse race in the world. After their first two horses didn’t work out, they found Hot Rod Charlie, the horse that currently has the fourth-best odds to win the Kentucky Derby this Saturday. Baby Chuck via Patrick O'Neill The people’s horseO’Neill said that the Boat Racing crew has received a lot of support from family and friends, but also from people they’ve never met. In every good horse movie—Seabiscuit, Hidalgo, Racing Stripes—there’s a brooding protagonist who, throughout everything, believes their horse can win. He’d seen the way betting on horse racing had driven wedges between families and friends in the past, even his own family at times. To even be considered for the big day, the horse has to be three years old, which means every horse running this year’s race was one of the 19,664 registered Thoroughbreds born in 2018. Patrick O’Neill grew up watching horse races and has always loved the sport. The crew, most of whom went into finance after graduating, approached wiggling into the high-dollar sport sort of like a hedge fund, pooling their money to own 25% of Chuck (O’Neill said we could call the horse by his nickname because we’re cool).</description>
