When a bank has excess cash on hand, it can loan it out to another one that needs it. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeOn Wednesday, the Fed is expected to hike interest rates even higher to bring inflation back from levels we haven’t seen in decades. Instead, the central bank adjusts what’s known as the “federal funds rate,” which is the average interest rate that banks pay each other for overnight loans. This week, we’re going to carve out some space to explore interest rate hikes from a variety of angles. The banks lending to each other typically settle on an interest rate near the midpoint of the Fed’s range. Because Fed Chair Jerome Powell doesn’t just show up at your bank and tell them to raise their interest rates. Like, what are the mechanics? What that is: Commercial banks borrow and lend money to each other so that they can meet liquidity requirements set by regulators before the business day begins. You should also know that the Fed picks a range for the federal funds rate—not a specific number. In March, when the Fed hiked interest rates for the first time following the onset of the pandemic, it raised its target range from 0–25 basis points to 25–50.</description>

It’s unlikely that Buffett has ever touched an Xbox controller, but Berkshire Hathaway is now the largest shareholder of Activision Blizzard after amassing a 9.5% stake. Around the topic of the stock market, Buffett said the influx of new traders buying and selling stocks during the pandemic has turned the market into “almost totally a casino” in which large American companies have become “poker chips.” Buffett said that inflation “swindles almost everybody” and was a result of the Fed’s gargantuan stimulus measures to prop up the economy during the pandemic. Of course, Buffett would never call it “buying the dip” because he doesn’t believe in timing the market. And…video games? So what did he buy? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>

The US jump-started its marine mammal military program in 1960, primarily employing bottlenose dolphins and sea lions to accomplish a variety of underwater tasks humans just don’t have the fins for. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeWe know a decent amount about the US’ use of marine mammals for military purposes after information was leaked about the program in 1992. Their most likely porpoise—sorry, purpose—is to defend Russian warships against enemy divers, serving as a crucial line of defense for what is Russia’s most important naval base on the Black Sea.While we can see you there looking shocked at the existence of a Russian dolphin infantry division…Marine mammals have a long history of military serviceAnd not just for the Russians. Dolphins’ skills were on display during the Iraq War in 2003. Big picture: Over time, humans have become a lot more skilled at leveraging marine mammals to win wars.</description>

  <title>When a dog-sitting gig turns into an awkward conversation with your boss</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. A key question I have is whether your boss is aware of your side hustle. I dog-sit as a side hustle, so I happily obliged when he asked if I was free. The first of the month is traditionally a big day for bones: Some of us owe them, others collect them, and a hip-hop group that bears the name gave us an iconic 90s track to help mark the calendar. What should I do? Anything nagging at you? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! My boss has a new puppy and needed someone to watch her for the weekend. Is it possible your boss was simply biding his time so that he could wake up and settle his debts with the rest of us today? Share your workplace conundrum with Make It Work here. Probably not, so let’s work out your best move here. I feel awkward asking, especially since he’s my boss, but I deserve to be paid for the work I did. Ask Shane here. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeEach week, our workplace whisperer Shane Loughnane answers a reader-submitted question about problems at work.</description>
