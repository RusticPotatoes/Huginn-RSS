  <title>Fed Boosts Economic Growth Projections, but Maintains Its Easy Money Strategy</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4421%2Ffederal_reserve_chair_jer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Fed said things do look better, then it’s increasingly hard to justify its current strategy of ultra-loose monetary policy, which is when the Fed uses its tools (like lowering interest rates) to juice the economy when it’s in the dumps. That’s not us trying to impress our middle school readers—it’s a direct quote from the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy statement yesterday.   As the US economy continues to rebound from its Covid-induced recession, the Fed projects GDP will grow 6.5% this year, a big jump from its previous estimate of 4.2% in December.</description>

  <title>Believe It or Not, Bitcoin Could Be Better Than Gold</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4404%2Fbitcoin_magic.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bitcoin is... A Bit of Bitcoin BasicsYou could think of Bitcoin as magic internet money—and yes, we at Morning Brew are known for our technical economics vocabulary.  Think GoldThe best case scenario for Bitcoin probably looks something like the consistent historical value of gold. What’s super cool is that, even if the hype fades, Bitcoin may actually more likely become ensconced in our society as a thing that stores value. Its Place in Your PortfolioBitcoin has a way to go when it comes to being taken seriously by institutions and governments.  The Invisible Potential of BitcoinYou can’t see Bitcoin. File under: The best tax help around. *Bitcoin has the potential to become the digital version of gold. While gold was once traded as a physical currency, its value in the stock market is no longer tied to its industrial value. Plenty of smart people think it’s a good move to invest in Bitcoin.</description>

  <title>NFTs, Bitcoin, SPACs, Snakers: Too Many Crazes to Count</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1241%2Fmr_krabs.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   A short listCrypto: Last March, bitcoin was hovering just above $5,000; on Saturday, it hit an all-time high above $61,000. The amount wagered on SPACs to fall in value has tripled since the start of the year, per the WSJ. Zoom out: No one knows exactly if/when any of these "mini-bubbles'' will pop but, at least in the SPAC world, some think it might be soon. Even NFTs were being developed as early as 2017. SPACs have been around for decades, sneaker-flipping dates back to 1985, and trading cards, well…you get the point. Plus, it’s not like any of the "crazes" described above are that new.</description>
