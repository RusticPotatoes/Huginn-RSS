  <title>Biden Administration Confronts Less Demand for Vaccines</title>

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb estimates that only 150 million Americans (less than half the population) will get a vaccine.</description>

  <title>Netflix Announces Disappointing Streamer Growth in 2021</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4797%2Fnetflix_still_watching.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Netflix remains the majority of viewers’ No. 1 choice of stream-and-chill service, and up to 92% of viewers that signed up for competing streaming services also have Netflix. Netflix predicted that in Q2 only 1 million net new subscribers will join the service—that would make it the worst quarter for subscriber growth on record. Of course, last year was special: In prime position to benefit from pandemic lockdowns, Netflix managed to increase its subscriber base to 204 million and bump up the price on its standard streaming plan by $1 and its premium tier by $2. Looking ahead... 2.</description>

  <title>Pew: 91% of US Adults Now Support Legalized Marijuana in Some Form</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3946%2Fnug_rocket.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018, and Mexico could follow soon. Legalization can bring big economic opportunity: The US marijuana industry already supports 300,000+ full-time jobs—more than the number of dentists in the country. Bottom line: "Legalization will eventually win, and the vast majority of states, if not all, will soon join the ranks of the legalizers," Vox writes.  In their latest survey, Pew found that 60% of US adults now support legalized recreational and medical use and an additional 31% back medical marijuana. And a lack of federal standards has led to inconsistency around testing, labeling, and marketing.</description>

  <title>Pew: 91% of US Adults Now Support Legalized Marijuana in Some Form</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3946%2Fnug_rocket.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018, and Mexico could follow soon. This month, New Mexico became the 17th state to allow recreational use. Even the South is cracking; starting in July, Virginia will allow recreational use. Tightly regulated distribution with restrictions on marketing, slow rollouts in some provinces, and less demand than expected have hurt. But success isn't a sure bet. Legalization can bring big economic opportunity: The US marijuana industry already supports 300,000+ full-time jobs—more than the number of dentists in the country. And a lack of federal standards has led to inconsistency around testing, labeling, and marketing.</description>
