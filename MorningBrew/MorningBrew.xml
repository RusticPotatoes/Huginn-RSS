  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/2WdOfxEu9ZcnWajI30/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Consumer loan bonds outpaced junk bonds, corporate loans, and mortgage-backed securities .   You’d be wrong  U.S. consumers are in fine form—by some measures.

This year has not been an easy one to be a business writer—though I’m lucky to have remained employed and many people’s jobs are way more challenging than mine.     So...   How do we know that? Those are a class of “asset-backed securities,” or financial instruments that bet on an asset, like a consumer loan, yielding a return. Plus, in the quarantine era, there just isn’t as much to spend money on. what does it all mean? big time.</description>

  <title>Moderna Vaccine Was 95% Effective in Phase 3 Trials</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3150/covid-19_vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Plus, Moderna's vaccine can hold for a month at a normal refrigerator freezer's temp, making it much easier to transport than Pfizer's, which requires -94°F.   The details: Moderna's month-long trial involved 30,000 volunteers split between placebo and vaccine groups. That rally comes despite rising U.S. cases and new restrictions, which could disproportionately hurt small-cap's profits this quarter, the WSJ reports. Yesterday, Moderna announced its vaccine was 94.5% effective in Phase 3 clinical trials, just one week after Pfizer bragged its vaccine was over 90% effective.</description>
