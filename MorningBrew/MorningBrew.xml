  <title>Warren Buffett Releases Annual Shareholder Letter and Berkshire Hathaway Earnings</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2248%2Fwarren_buffett.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s left Buffett with a huge cash pile he’s increasingly using for stock buybacks.  Let’s start with Berkshire Hathaway performance Berkshire is a conglomerate that wholly owns firms in industries such as insurance, railroads, and retail. Berkshire also bought back almost $25 billion of its own stock last year, reducing the total number of outstanding shares and increasing current investors’ ownership.  Looking ahead...  But notice what isn’t there: the pandemic, racial justice protests, the election, GameStop, and crypto. “There has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America.”</description>

Khashoggi’s killing drew outrage from the international media and US lawmakers, and investigations zeroed in on the role of Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the 35-year-old de facto ruler of the kingdom.   </description>

  <title>Why Does Every Streaming Service Have a Plus Sign?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4191%2Fparamount_plus.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some industry analysts think that streaming services may be in a better position for the long-term if they can resist adding the plus sign.  Off the top of my head I can count Discovery+, Disney+, ESPN+, Apple TV+, BET+, and AMC+. we may not have another streaming service with a + for a while, because we may not even have a new streaming service for a while.  "Our research confirmed that the plus sign has become synonymous with streaming video on demand services," David Leavy, chief operating officer for Discovery, told the LA Times. As CNBC notes, Paramount+ is the last of the big streaming unveils that started with Apple TV+ in March 2019.</description>

  <title>How to File Your Taxes as an LLC</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4182%2Ftaxe_time.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, maybe an E (real estate, royalties, and other stuff), or an F (farmers, what’s up).  Now, there are a couple ways to file as an LLC: If you’re a single-member LLC (you own the business, and only you) and you’re filing as an individual, you’ll report your income and expenses on a 1040 (individual income tax return) and a Schedule C (profit or loss from an unincorporated business).  If you have employees, you’ll file separately from a 1040 or 1065: Estimated Tax: 1040-ESSocial Security, Medicare, and Income Tax Withholding: 941, 943, 944 More Info on Social Security, Medicare, and Income Tax Withholding: W-2, W-3 Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax: 940 You may also need to work through issues like information returns (payments to and transactions with non-employees) and excise taxes (taxes paid on certain goods, like gas). Or you simply like to decompress with a weighted blanket and some tax documents?</description>
