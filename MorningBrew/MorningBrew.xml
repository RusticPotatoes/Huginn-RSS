I think you couldn‚Äôt have done the show without that. I think it‚Äôs important to try to represent the original character as much as possible. So, like, I‚Äôm Korean. Let me try out the show in Korean. And if I don‚Äôt like it, I could just click away.‚Äù Most of Pachinko‚Äôs main cast is of Korean descent. What‚Äôs so interesting is that you realize all around the world, they‚Äôve been watching American content in subtitles for so long now.</description>

  <title>NYC's salary transparency law faces pushback from businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/81f06e22894fc31f01a6ebb7a1445b6b022c14db-1024x683.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeNew York City‚Äôs monumental pay transparency law is set to take effect on May 15, meaning that nearly every company operating in the city will have to include a pay range for all open job listings. Critics of the amendment said these employees‚Äîincluding those in the food services and retail industries‚Äîare some of the city‚Äôs most marginalized workers who are most in need of pay transparency. During testimony over the amendment, some small-business advocates also claimed the law would allow larger companies to easily outbid them for talented hires. While the law is still set to go into effect on May 15, the amended bill is currently in committee. But a proposed amendment to the law‚Äîsupported by large business groups and under consideration by the city council‚Äîcould limit its scope, create room for loopholes, and delay its implementation until November. ‚ÄîMK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In a letter to the City Council, the Partnership for New York City (a powerful business group) criticized it for lacking input from the employers it would affect. But radical transparency has proven effective at addressing the wage gap and giving employees an idea of what their work is worth. In the original wording of the amendment, businesses with 15 or fewer employees would be exempt‚Äîa change that would have removed around 58,000 NYC companies and 500,000 employees from the scope of the law. That‚Äôs a big deal, as pay transparency laws exist largely to address racial and gender pay gaps.</description>

Still, the broader travel rebound has been fueled not by companies, but by individuals: US consumers in AmEx‚Äôs network spent 120% more on travel in Q1 than in the same period in 2019. Travel spend in March by S&amp;P 500 clients was ‚Äúwell over over 50%‚Äù of its level in 2019, which execs hailed as a big win. It tees up a potential investigation of Twitter over free-speech restrictions if Republicans were to win a majority in the House this November. House Republicans demanded that Twitter preserve all materials linked to Elon Musk‚Äôs bid to buy the company, calling the board‚Äôs opposition to the takeover offer ‚Äúconcerning.‚Äù</description>

  <title>Why Germany can‚Äôt quit Russian gas</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. That toll: The country‚Äôs central bank reported yesterday that an embargo on Russian gas would plunge it into a recession; Instead of Germany‚Äôs economy growing by 3% this year, it would shrink by 2%, amounting to one of the worst recessions in the country since the financial crisis. As a result, cutting off Russian gas would force some of Germany‚Äôs industrial production to shut down and put an estimated 400,000+ people out of work. ‚ÄîNF ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an alternative energy source.‚Äù German businesses would face their ‚Äúworst crisis since the Second World War‚Äù if a gas embargo were put into effect, the CEO Martin Bruderm√ºller of chemicals giant BASF warned. Big picture: With an immediate gas embargo seemingly off the table, Europe is trying to get creative to reduce its consumption of Russian energy. But since then, Germany has become even more dependent on Russian gas as it wound down other power sources, such as nuclear and coal, but didn‚Äôt build up enough alternatives to replace them.</description>

Disney‚Äôs been operating the special administrative zone, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, for 55 years. David Ramba, executive director of the Florida Association of Special Districts, told CNBC that he hasn‚Äôt seen any special districts get dissolved that didn‚Äôt want to be dissolved, not to mention one run by a $222 billion corporation. ‚ÄîNF css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>
