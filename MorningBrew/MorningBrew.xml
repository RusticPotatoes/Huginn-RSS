  <title>Mona Lisa smeared with cake in apparent climate protest</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Good news is that Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece, probably the most recognizable painting in the world, was not damaged by the caking. A man who disguised himself as an elderly woman in a wheelchair smeared cake on the iconic painting’s glass case at the Louvre yesterday in what appeared to be a climate protest. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe “Mona Lisa” is protected by bulletproof glass, and yesterday we found out that it’s properly shielded against cake, too. Big picture: Something about the “Mona Lisa” gets people riled up, and yesterday’s attack was not the first time the portrait’s been messed with…It was stolen by three Italian handymen in 1911, which actually helped boost its status.</description>

  <title>Pools, restaurants brace for another summer of worker shortages</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. On the one hand, Americans are basically done with home-cooked meals. Given the shortage of workers in other age cohorts, more teens are working now than they have since the 2008–09 financial crisis. Even after dangling a $2,500 incentive, the city can’t find enough staff. And a lack of lifeguards could prevent one-third of the 300,000+ public pools in the US from opening this summer, the American Lifeguard Association warned. How to explain it?</description>

On a podcast this week, Bankman-Fried (nicknamed SBF) said that he expects to give at least $100 million in political donations for the upcoming 2024 election, and could spend up to $1 billion if Donald Trump were a factor. )Some think that SBF has other motives with his political giving. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}.</description>

  <title>Make it work: How should I utilize a mentor?</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. In fact, one of the ways I would look to utilize this mentor is to gain access to the people that they know. The key to figuring out how to utilize a mentor starts with understanding a mentor’s purpose. In order to best utilize your mentor, you’ll want to 1) make sure they know what problems you’re running into 2) have some level of visibility into your work and 3) have insight into your short- and long-term goals. Most were not officially assigned and, sadly, none were actually named Mentor.</description>

Then they hired Allen Klein, which led to great discord within the group and damaged their financial affairs. There are also biases when men interview women, at least on average. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. More generally, many interviewers are trying too hard to look for people who are a lot like them. To help us become better talent spotters in a world where spotting talent is increasingly important, economist Tyler Cowen and venture capitalist and entrepreneur Daniel Gross wrote a book on the art and science of finding talent at the highest level. Many highly successful individuals are terrible at talent assessment. This interview has been condensed.</description>

Most were not officially assigned and, sadly, none were actually named Mentor.</description>

  <title>Hey, Miso Robot—can I get fries with that?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/e353f9d9fcd860e440ec66f597542d4f533911da-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s what the future of quick-service restaurants (QSR) could look like with Miso Robotics. When it’s combined, you see a robot doing the work of roughly two people during peak periods in a quiet, seamless, and very efficient way. We're not just going to wake up one day, and there’ll be 1.5 million new workers happily jumping into the restaurant industry. We really see ourselves as a solution to the labor crisis in the quick serve restaurant industry. from our sponsorFired up about Flippy and its robot siblings? When someone sees Flippy taking frozen fries all the way through to the cook station and serving cooked fries, you can kinda just drop the mic. What do you see Miso’s role in the restaurant industry? And the automation guy is saying, “I think that the technology has now evolved in such a way that it’s approachable and affordable today for a robot to take over some of the tasks.” What Flippy does is simple: It takes frozen fries all the way through the fry process and dispenses cooked fries. Yeah, so if you look at fast-food restaurants, fries go with almost every order. Miso is still open to investors as they take on the $300B US Quick Serve Restaurant Industry. I was talking to some of the workers who have had one of our Flippy units installed for the longest period of time. Our mission is to automate restaurants, and we’re starting with automating fry stations. Where did the idea for the Flippy come from?</description>
