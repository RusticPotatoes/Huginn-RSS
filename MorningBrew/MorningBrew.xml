  <title>Warren Buffett, David Solomon Urge Congress to Extend PPP for Small Businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3431/warren_buffett.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  PPP has been criticized for fraud and not actually going to small businesses. It's a $525 billion government program intended to help small businesses keep workers on payroll. In an interview with CNBC yesterday morning, legendary investor Warren Buffett urged Congress to pass legislation to help small businesses stay afloat. Help could be on the way if Congress gets the job done.   A real-world example: This summer, American Airlines was able to raise $2.5 billion from selling bonds even as it was bleeding $58 million/day.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Qve6HBxgvPw3BCdsFF/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Buttigieg endorsed Biden and helped him raise money, despite Biden having run an ad mocking Buttigieg's relatively paltry experience.     More broadly, Buttigieg will manage a nearly $90 billion budget, plus oversee the agencies that regulate railroads, trucking, and aviation.</description>

Reduce overall emissions intensity by 15%–20% Halve methane emission intensity Emission “intensity”?</description>

It's expected to get approval. The remaining challenges Spoilage: Pfizer's vaccine needs to maintain -94°F, and although the company has equipped shipping containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled temperature sensors, it's expected that some doses won't survive the journey.  </description>

  <title>Your Candy Bar Has a Dark Secret</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3391/chocolate.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Originally filed in 2005, the case alleges the companies violated international laws against child slavery." Nestlé and Cargill say they've made efforts to eliminate child labor from supply chains. The chocolate supply chain is riddled with child labor.    That's one of the problems with the cocoa supply chain.   An October report from the Labor Department estimates ~1.6 million children are working on cocoa farms. A decision on the side of Nestlé and Cargill could affect future human rights cases brought under the ATS.    This case could have big implications for corporate liability The case centers on the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), a provision nearly as old as the U.S. that provides a path for foreign nationals to sue over violations of international law or U.S. treaties abroad in American courts.   This wasn't the Court's first dance with ATS.   They won't have to worry...   Ex.: The ATS has been invoked in conversations around corporate liability for supply chains linked to imprisoned Uighur Muslims in China."   While the justices weren't convinced that ATS was the right statute to use in pursuit of this case...</description>

  <title>Sony Buys Crunchyroll, Consolidates the Big Business of Bringing Japanese Anime to Western Viewers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/qWnoVy8UlX3A44dtQk/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Netflix can appease the casual viewer by sprinkling shows and movies into its existing service, while Funimation x Crunchyroll can satisfy the straight-from-Japan needs of the truly anime-obsessed.   Crunchyroll gives Sony a Snorlax-sized foothold in anime  In 2019, Sony combined three anime streaming services under its roof—France’s Wakanim, Australia’s Madman Anime Group, and the U.S.' Funimation—into a joint venture between Sony Pictures Entertainment and Sony Music Entertainment’s subsidiary, Aniplex. On Wednesday, Sony-owned anime streaming service Funimation agreed to acquire anime streaming service Crunchyroll from AT&amp;T for $1.2 billion. But getting anime from Japan to the U.S. has historically been a slow and painful process. Medium dive: Read this Quora answer on the history of anime production, this Reddit thread on financing, and “The Dark Side of Japan’s Anime Industry” by Eric Margolis. Crunchyroll will also be folded into this streaming giant, which could mean a complete merger or just an exchange of content. Here’s how it works: Most anime is a collaboration between a studio and a production committee. That rabid love raises the question of whether anime is better suited to an all-in-one streamer like Netflix or a standalone service like Crunchyroll. Once an anime gets made, distribution is quick and painless... Deep dive: Listen to Anime in America from Crunchyroll and read The Soul of Anime: Collaborative Creativity and Japan’s Media Success Story by Ian Condry. there’s room for both Sony and Netflix to be successful anime streamers if the genre’s appeal continues to grow beyond its most hardcore fans. Enter: streaming services Pay-per-month services are getting anime to Western fans in two ways: The Crunchyroll way: In 2006, Crunchyroll started as a quasi-legal YouTube channel for fan-subtitled anime, but evolved into an above-board streaming service in 2009. When Cartoon Network started Toonami (part of Adult Swim) in 1997, the co-creators looked beyond the U.S. for more adult cartoons at the turn of the millennia. Foreign: U.S. media companies didn’t think there would be demand for content that’s not from Hollywood. Both will achieve the same end goal: exporting Japanese anime to Western audiences. Sometimes, major studios like Kyoto Animation and Shaft are part of the production committees themselves, according to this highly detailed Reddit post.   Looking ahead... Adult Swim SVP Jason DeMarco wrote on Twitter that it’s “doubtful” any of the original shows Toonami and Crunchyroll are currently co-producing will be affected.</description>

What is Slack’s video function but an opportunity for embarrassment waiting to happen? We aren’t so sure. “At corporate holiday parties, you typically get a handful of folks who end up drinking too much and do something embarrassing,” Ryan Costello of Event Farm told the WSJ.</description>

  <title>FDA Approves Pfizer-BioNTech Vaccine, Raising Questions Over Who Counts as Essential</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3380/covid_shot_line.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Now comes the hard part  Pfizer, BioNTech, and other manufacturers have generated lifesaving products at a breathtaking speed...   Bottom line: It will ultimately fall to the states to decide which workers are “essential” enough to receive the first, limited doses of the vaccine. Currently, the only clear directive is that healthcare workers and residents of long-term care facilities go first—and no industry reps dispute that.   Unblinding would hamstring the research process... but it would also get people vaccinated.</description>
