Because the brief, unsigned order came in response to an emergency petition, making it part of the court’s so-called shadow docket, where decisions get made quickly and without the benefit of oral arguments. But with the case all but guaranteed to end up back at the high court for a final say eventually, it does not tell us much about what the justices will ultimately decide when it gets there. And it’s going to rage: The matter reached the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Texas yanked the FDA’s approval of the drug. —AR What comes next? Why not? The government quickly appealed to the conservative-leaning US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which rejected parts of the judge’s decision but still imposed restrictions on the medicine’s availability. Meanwhile, the same day the Texas ruling came out, a Washington federal judge ordered the FDA not to restrict access to the pill in 17 states. The case is scheduled to pick back up with oral arguments at the 5th Circuit on May 17. The Supreme Court’s decision means the status quo will be maintained while that all gets sorted out.</description>

Since Heinerscheid became the first woman ever to lead Bud Light’s marketing last June, she set out to revive the declining brand by appealing to women and younger people. According to Beer Business Daily, Bud Light sales fell 10.7% the week ended April 8, while shares in rival Molson Coors appear to have gotten at least a short-term lift. This partnership did not sit well with many conservatives, who attacked Bud Light for being another corporation that went “woke” by prioritizing inclusivity.

Zoom out: The UN says that India’s population could start declining in 2047. It’s due to surpass China as the most populous country on the planet this year, according to a UN report released this week. The India “buy” caseIndia has a lot going for it, including a massive labor force. India has already eclipsed its former colonizer, the United Kingdom, as the world’s fifth-largest economy, and it’s projected to nick Germany’s No. 4 spot by 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal. What’s holding India back? —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There are 900 million(! But India also has plenty of homegrown success stories. India’s domination of the global economy is far from guaranteed. India better put on some shades or risk being blinded by the spotlight. And word on the pundit street is that it’s poised to get bigger in another way—by rivaling China and the US as a major economic superpower. It’s paying off: Companies looking to diversify their supply chains away from China have embraced India as an alternative manufacturing hub. And that number is increasing—unlike in most major economies, where an aging population is sapping economic growth. Let’s explore why India’s future looks bright, and some of the obstacles on its path to international economic stardom. Apple recently began assembling its new iPhone in the country, and Volvo signaled it might start building EVs there. Nobel Prize-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee thinks India should look inward before it projects its economic ambitions abroad.</description>

One solution: Get some corporate roommates by subleasing part or all of their office space to other companies. But that doesn’t work for a company that already has a lease, and it doesn’t give the owner the option of ending the sublease at some point when their own company is big enough to fill all the desks—which Paffmann told the Brew can be one reason companies, like the one he worked with, sublease in the first place. According to Mobley, Publicis has listed their space so one company could take over the whole building, or multiple tenants could divvy it up. Michael Paffmann, CEO of VirgoPR, told Morning Brew his company subleases NYC office space from a larger company for eight employees who go in to work two to three times a week. And while Mobley said timesharing is a trend (and has been for a long time for medical offices), he said, “It doesn’t appear to be a big enough trend in traditional office use to really be moving the needle at this point.” Over 250 million square feet of office space is currently available for sublease. For instance, one company comes in on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, while another uses the desks on Wednesday and Friday.</description>

Because the brief, unsigned order came in response to an emergency petition, making it part of the court’s so-called shadow docket, where decisions get made quickly and without the benefit of oral arguments. But with the case all but guaranteed to end up back at the high court for a final say eventually, it does not tell us much about what the justices will ultimately decide when it gets there. And it’s going to rage: The matter reached the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Texas yanked the FDA’s approval of the drug. —AR What comes next? Why not? The government quickly appealed to the conservative-leaning US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which rejected parts of the judge’s decision but still imposed restrictions on the medicine’s availability. Meanwhile, the same day the Texas ruling came out, a Washington federal judge ordered the FDA not to restrict access to the pill in 17 states. The case is scheduled to pick back up with oral arguments at the 5th Circuit on May 17. The Supreme Court’s decision means the status quo will be maintained while that all gets sorted out.</description>

A settlement of this magnitude reflects the gravity of the caseDominion, which makes electronic voting machines, sued Fox News for defamation, accusing the network of knowingly pushing baseless claims that Dominion helped rig the 2020 presidential election in Joe Biden’s favor. For democracy…critics of Fox News were universally disappointed that the case didn’t go to trial. The judge presiding over the case had already ruled that Fox News’s statements about Dominion’s role in the 2020 election were false. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeRight before starting its hugely anticipated libel trial, Fox News told Dominion Voting Systems, “How about we pay you $787.5 million and we not do this.” They say that in pushing former President Trump’s false “rigged election” narrative, Fox News helped foment the distrust of elections that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol—and this settlement doesn’t hold the network accountable. —NF css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Last month, a NY judge allowed the case to proceed. For Dominion…well, we’ll just let the $787.5 million do the talking, considering the company generates less than $100 million per year in sales, per Axios’s Dan Primack.</description>

Despite the launch of its $6.99 ad tier to attract more users, Netflix added 1.75 million net subscribers, about 500,000 short of expectations. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeExactly one year ago, Netflix dropped the bombshell that it had lost subscribers for the first time in 10 years, leading to a nearly 35% stock wipeout the next day. Soon, it won’t even have its DVD rental service to fall back on. Plus, Netflix’s sports docuseries about golf and tennis intended to build off of its Formula One hit are not remotely close to as popular. —MM Leeches of the family, rejoice!</description>

  <title>Fox will pay $787.5m to settle Dominion defamation suit</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/d6eff48b05aba4c3c5c5e00f9454296e6e499571-1024x683.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. A settlement of this magnitude reflects the gravity of the caseDominion, which makes electronic voting machines, sued Fox News for defamation, accusing the network of knowingly pushing baseless claims that Dominion helped rig the 2020 presidential election in Joe Biden’s favor. For democracy…critics of Fox News were universally disappointed that the case didn’t go to trial. The judge presiding over the case had already ruled that Fox News’s statements about Dominion’s role in the 2020 election were false. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeRight before starting its hugely anticipated libel trial, Fox News told Dominion Voting Systems, “How about we pay you $787.5 million and we not do this.” They say that in pushing former President Trump’s false “rigged election” narrative, Fox News helped foment the distrust of elections that led to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol—and this settlement doesn’t hold the network accountable. —NF css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Last month, a NY judge allowed the case to proceed. For Dominion…well, we’ll just let the $787.5 million do the talking, considering the company generates less than $100 million per year in sales, per Axios’s Dan Primack.</description>

  <title>Fox News v. Dominion trial delayed over reported settlement talks</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/e158a2a37eabe46a41e8bea11cc1f46f1779676f-1024x683.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Due to the precedent set in a 1964 Supreme Court case, Dominion has to demonstrate that Fox News acted with “actual malice” when reporting on it; in other words, that it recklessly disregarded the truth in its statements about Dominion. However, court documents have revealed that Fox News hosts privately admitted they did not believe the fraud claims they were making on air. Looking ahead…the judge presiding over this case has already ruled that it was “CRYSTAL clear” that Fox News’s statements about Dominion’s role in the 2020 election were false. What the case is aboutDominion Voting Systems, which makes electronic voting machines, has sued Fox News for defamation, accusing the network of knowingly pushing baseless claims about the company after the 2020 presidential election—including that it rigged vote counts to tilt the election in Joe Biden’s favor. The showdown between Fox News and Dominion was supposed to begin this morning, but last night the Delaware Superior Court delayed the start until tomorrow without providing a reason. css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Fox News lawyers say the network is fully covered by its First Amendment rights—it was simply commenting on the election fraud claims made by former President Trump, which were newsworthy because he was the president of the US. While that’s not an insignificant amount of money, this case is being called the “Super Bowl” of libel cases for nonfinancial reasons: It could have lasting consequences for Fox News as well as the media industry’s First Amendment rights.</description>

Everything about this launch pushes the limits of conventional space flight:Starship is made of stainless steel, which the space industry has typically shunned for its weight. Musk has acknowledged this flight might not go as planned. That could allow it to refuel on Mars, since the planet’s atmosphere contains trace amounts of the gas. Today at 8am ET, a two-and-a-half-hour launch window will open for Starship and the Super Heavy booster it’s mounted on.</description>
