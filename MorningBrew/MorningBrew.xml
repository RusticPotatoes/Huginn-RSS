  <title>In Atlanta, a Tech Hub Rises Among the Peach Orchards</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7459%2Fusa_georgia_atlanta_cit.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In other Atlanta tech deals last week... Microsoft will hire 1,500 people at its new Atlanta office, Apple is partnering on a $50 million tech center, and Airbnb, explicitly citing the prevalence of Black talent in Atlanta, also plans to open a hub in the city. The city is home to a cluster of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College.  Tech companies that have pledged to increase diversity in their workforces are eyeing Atlanta’s Black engineering talent. A recent string of deals has put Atlanta on the map as a growing power player in the US technology industry.</description>

  <title>Make It Work</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We have an unlimited PTO policy. How do I ask for days off? Ask Shane here. One thing that’s not unlimited is your mental and physical health, so don’t cheat yourself out of the time you need to properly recharge. Each week, our workplace whisperer Shane Loughnane answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. HR Brew. Have a question about work you want to ask Shane? Try asking about the minimum amount of PTO they would expect you to take. They’ve empowered you to determine how much time off you can realistically take without compromising that work—and while I’d recommend a more modest approach until you get a feel for where that line is, I don’t think a few days off during the holidays is an unreasonable place to start. It’s a good move to ask your manager if they have any preferences.</description>

  <title>FDA Advisory Panel: Boomers Can Get Boosters</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7467%2Fvaccine_boosters.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Last month, President Biden said the booster shot rollout would begin September 20, but some health experts (including two senior FDA officials) have pushed back, saying there wasn’t enough data yet to show a third shot was necessary. Other loud voices have urged the US to add a third shot to the standard vaccine regimen—voices like those of the vaccine makers themselves. That decision throws a wrench i the Biden administration’s plans to roll out boosters to US adults beginning next week.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Kat Cole</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7464%2Fkat_cole_headshot.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the aroma of Auntie Anne’s makes me want to eat a pretzel, like, “Must. And people are going to pay a premium for it. Like, I just got opportunities earlier than most people would. And where experience is valued, there still might be some automation in a piece of the production but that human element is going to be increasingly cherished. Probably every two months. Do you think your original position as a Hooters server will exist 10 years from now? What I think people might miss about my two long stints at the same parent enterprise is I was in super high-growth companies, and so really I was running multiple different companies—I just didn’t have to leave the entity to do it. The Cinnabon aroma is a bit more magic, and intoxicating, and the Auntie Anne’s aroma is kind of like, “Take all my money.” It’s indulgent, and I am satisfied almost just from that aroma. Then, she joined Focus Brands, the parent company of Cinnabon, Auntie Anne’s, and other chains, where she became President and COO. Yes, I learned over time to be a really thoughtful, caring, and driven leader, but you cannot remove a high-growth company from that equation.  Yes, I would make it fully remote, and I would put in some really killer and regular moments of in-person connection when it would be safe and possible.</description>

  <title>Food Delivery Apps Are Suing NYC and Other Cities</title>
