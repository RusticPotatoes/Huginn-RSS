  <title>Strictest Abortion Law in the Country Goes Into Effect in Texas </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6481%2Ftexas_house_republicans_r.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;while it’s so far stayed quiet on the Texas law, the Supreme Court—now with a 6–3 conservative majority—will hear a major abortion case in the fall over Mississippi’s request to enforce an abortion ban 15 weeks after pregnancy begins.  It is the most restrictive abortion law in the country and could lead many abortion providers to shut their doors. “The lawsuits would be against the individuals making money off of the abortion, the abortion industry itself.” This law threatens my livelihood,” Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, an OB-GYN and abortion provider in Texas, told NPR.</description>

But more realistically, pick one. and Maddie will be like, “Do you mean Lara?” Make sure your 401(k) is in a good spot and consider opening a Roth IRA before Mercury goes into retrograde. That can only mean one thing: gold. Like, real gold is metal, it must stick to a magnet. Either way, use caution and wear sunscreen. Taurus: (April 20–May 20)Little known fact: NFT actually stands for Now Flirt with a Taurus. ] Virgo: (August 23–September 22)This month, you’ll get the gift you had your eye on, find ten bucks on the street, and your nemesis will have a setback at work. Remember, you only have 86,400 seconds in the day that you can’t get back. Wait, gold is magnetic, right? More like Econo-you-and-me.” That’s right, find an artist you like-like, ask them about NFTs, and watch the sparks fly. Let’s get into your September horoscopes.

  <title>Allbirds Becomes Latest DTC Startup to Make a Run at the Public Markets</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6460%2Fallbirds_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Allbirds and Warby Parker are just a couple wildebeests in a bigger stampede of consumer-facing companies headed to the public markets.  Both Allbirds and Warby Parker successfully leveraged online channels to attract urban millennials comfortable with buying apparel on the internet. Warby is also ditching the classic IPO playbook by going public via direct listing, which means it’s not actually going to raise any money in the process.  Sounds familiarIn that way, and in many others, it’s similar to Warby Parker, the e-commerce eyewear seller that filed to go public last week.</description>

  <title>What You Need to Know About Elizabeth Holmes’s Trial That Starts Today</title>

Jury selection begins today for the criminal fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of shuttered Silicon Valley biotech startup Theranos. Holmes’s net worth also grew to $4.5 billion, good enough for No. 1 on the Forbes list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women. From there, investors started suing for fraud, the government yanked the company’s blood-testing license, and in September 2018, the SEC dissolved Theranos. — MM</description>

Holmes’s net worth also grew to $4.5 billion, good enough for No. 1 on the Forbes list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women. Fall into a Theranos rabbit hole: The WSJ reporter who broke the story, John Carreyrou, wrote a riveting book about the fraud called Bad Blood. The downfall of Theranos may have briefly scared investors into looking closer at pitch decks, but it may take more than a conviction to change the Valley’s entrenched “fake it ’til you make it” mindset. Balwani’s lawyers called the claims “deeply offensive.”</description>

  <title>Oxygen Runs in Short Supply for Covid-19 Patients, Water Treatment, and Space Missions</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6439%2Foxygen_tank.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid oxygen is used to treat the water supply, but the city is running low because of the crush of Covid hospitalizations.   But diverting oxygen to hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients means it can’t be deployed for other uses. As if the Southeast US didn’t have enough to deal with already, hospitals are running low on oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients, and it’s causing ripple effects for other industries that use the stuff for their daily operations.</description>

  <title>Powerfull Hurricane Ida Makes Landfall in Louisiana</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6438%2Fnoaa.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As of late last night, the only power to the city was coming from generators. this is the beginning, not the end, of the Ida story. Hurricane Ida slammed into Louisiana on exactly the same date, Aug. 29, as Katrina did in 2005.  The entire city of New Orleans was left without power, according to the regional energy provider Entergy.  Looking ahead... If refineries suffer a direct hit, gas prices could rise by about 10 cents in many East Coast markets. And 60% of gasoline used on the East Coast comes from Gulf Coast refineries.</description>

  <title>Why Are Rent Prices Surging?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6385%2Ffor_rent_housing.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turns out the No. 1 comeback story of the year isn’t jeans—it’s rental prices.  Housing is too expensive: Skyrocketing housing prices are causing some would-be homeowners to choose renting instead. Now, rent prices in 87 of the country’s 100 largest cities have fully returned to pre-pandemic levels.</description>

Because of higher Covid-19 hospitalizations, the city was running low on liquid oxygen, which is used to treat the water supply.

  <title>How Tim Cook Changed Apple in the 10 Years He's Been CEO</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/TLm3ig25UPL7roCPLC/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s right, Cook has been the CEO of Apple for exactly 10 years this week. Cook still has plenty of problems to deal with, from high-stakes legal challenges against Apple’s App Store policies to a more vocal workforce to thorny privacy questions. While the iPhone still reigns supreme, Apple has expanded its hardware lineup in the last decade and scored hits with the Apple Watch and AirPods. It also made a big move into services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, etc. Looking ahead... did (admittedly a low bar). What did your partner get you for your 10th anniversary?</description>

  <title>‘Monster’ Mike Schultz Talks the Paralympic Games, Winning Gold in 2018, and Disney Channel Original Movies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6433%2Fmike_schultz.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What’s more difficult: Winning a gold medal at the Paralympics or starting a company? But running a business or starting a business is an ongoing set of challenges. I'm going to have to go watch it again and refresh my memory.  To learn about what it takes to be a Paralympic champion, we chatted with gold medal-winning snowboarder Mike Schultz. After my injury in 2008, I really started spending a lot more time with the horses. What is something most people don't know about competing at the Paralympics? Yes, it's been a long time.  When I won gold and was able to stand on top of the podium and listen to the national anthem start playing, man, that is a very powerful moment that not many people get to experience.</description>

  <title>Same-day Streaming Causes Movie Piracy to Ramp Up</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3303%2Ftv_movie_theater.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While streaming platforms may recoup some money lost to piracy via digital rentals and subscriber growth (which has boomed for Disney+, HBO Max, and Netflix), theaters won’t see a cent of that. Black Widow was the most pirated movie in the world for three weeks running after it was released on Disney+ and in theaters on July 9, according to piracy-monitoring site TorrentFreak. What pirated movies used to look like: shaky camcorder recordings of movies taken in theaters and uploaded to piracy sites. Black Widow, The Suicide Squad, Jungle Cruise, and other would-be blockbusters simultaneously debuted in theaters and on streaming services in summer 2021. Theater owners are blaming the recent phenomenon of same-day releases for a spike in piracy.</description>
