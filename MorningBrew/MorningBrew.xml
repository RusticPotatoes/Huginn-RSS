  <title>The Biggest Changes To the Post-Pandemic Workplace Will Be Invisible</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ZlgwEg24rPhv9cju8K/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If we look at a) Sydney, Australia, and Nottingham, UK, which have intermittently resumed office work and b) US companies’ latest plans for post-pandemic office space, it’s clear most workplaces will look more like futuristic WeWorks than Mr. Nobody’s White Room. offices will likely have stricter (and more obvious) protocols when employees first return, and like what’s currently happening in Australia, they may have to toggle back and forth between fully open and shut down until Covid-19 flare-ups are under control. Google's blog shows off Camp CharlestonThe other way offices will get more fresh air to employees? Bottom line: From air filtration to green spaces, the office transformations discussed so far will be implemented to make employees feel—and actually be—safer from the spread of disease, especially Covid-19, while working at the office. Other changes will focus on accommodating newly hybrid workforcesMany workers who’ve spent the past 1+ years cooking elaborate breakfasts aren’t ready to return to microwaved oatmeal: 30% of employees would seek out a different job if their companies returned to fully in-office work following the pandemic, per a Mckinsey survey. but not so much that employees will have to battle for workspaces like they’re going full seagull on each other for kettle chips. It’s when employees “rent” a desk for the day, or hours at a time, and share it with other coworkers when they’re OOO. It depends on how many days each employee swipes in, which will vary by workplace. At Adtrak, employees will book their desks in advance through an app.</description>

  <title>Democrats Announce $3.5 Trillion Budget Plan</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5265%2Fwhite_house_budget.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Democrats will need to find a way to raise or suspend it soon to avoid economic chaos. One high-stakes battle remains: the debt ceiling, aka the limit on the US' ability to borrow money. Unfortunately for them, Democrats could push it through later this year without any GOP support thanks to their thin majority in the Senate.</description>

  <title>What You Need to Know About The UNs New Climate Report</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5370%2Fco2.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The report blamed one particular human activity for exacerbating climate change: burning fossil fuels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an official UN task force, released a 3,949-page report from 234 scientists yesterday that called current climate change trends a “code red for humanity.” But they need to speed up those cuts dramatically, the report argued.    “This report must sound a death knell for coal and fossil fuels before they destroy our planet," UN Secretary-general Antonio Guterres said.</description>

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an official UN task force, released a 3,949-page report from 234 scientists representing 45+ different countries yesterday morning that it called a “code red for humanity.” The report blamed one particular human activity for exacerbating climate change: burning fossil fuels. Since the IPCC’s last big report in 2013, the world has done a better job in curbing carbon emissions.</description>

The budget will require the backing of every Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, plus the tie breaking vote of VP Kamala Harris, to pass. Where will the money come from? The plan didn’t include lifting the debt ceiling, which would allow Uncle Sam to keep on borrowing to fund the spending.</description>

  <title>The new office politics? An ‘existential crisis’ for some</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6166%2Fpeople_talking_in_office_hallway.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lat speaks about a law firm that recently decreed employees must return to the office five days a week, only to be met with staff reaching out en masse to recruiters for jobs elsewhere. You may have heard of this described as the “hybrid” work environment, where some people work from home and others log on from a corporate office. The idea that office politics are winnable? “That might not be a bad thing because there are a lot of artificial deadlines of, ‘I want this on my desk first thing in the morning’ by bosses who, lo and behold, don’t read that until the afternoon or the next day,” he says.  The shift to a virtual workplace was hard on office politics, too, particularly in hidebound industries like finance and law where remote work was relatively rare before the pandemic. For example, some workers are easing their sense of urgency around work projects, Lat notes, because it proved to be a charade all along. What I’ve seen and heard from workers is that now, when a manager steps in, they’re actually getting in the way of work.” “The invisible work women have always done is finally being recognized and appreciated because men had to experience it,” says Dawn Bovasso, a freelance creative director in Boston who has written about workplace policies’ effects on women. “The old way was really exclusive, excluding a lot of people: people of color, women, the differently abled—a lot of people,” she says.  If the performative politics of pre-pandemic office life are a bowl of ice cream, the pandemic surely melted it. “This new way is going to be inclusive. If the corporate world’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic turned 2020 into a mad scramble for new protocols defined by adaptive office tools like Google Docs, Slack, and Zoom, then its adjustment to a tentative recovery suggests a partial return to the office and semi normalcy. “A lot of office politics is over stupid stuff and a lot of that stupid stuff is tied to the physical environment: fighting over the corner office, talking so loudly on calls that coworkers can hear them down the hall, being bad at bathroom etiquette, vaping at your desk, leaving smelly food in the break room,” he says. The virtual environment has undoubtedly given workers more power over their supervisors. “It is challenging to replicate office politics in a virtual era, which isn’t a bad thing,” says David Lat, a longtime analyst of law firm culture and himself a former top-tier recruiter. “So much of politics arises from physical interaction, so if we have less interaction we have less cause for conflict and less need for politics.” True, the completely virtual environment that many people have been working in for 17 months has hardly been a cakewalk.</description>

  <title>Senate Debates Crypto Provision That Opponents Say Would Harm Industry in US</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3DzwbT4oF52JG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to use the $28 billion raised through tighter crypto regulation to help pay for the infrastructure bill. Tucked in to the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill is a provision that expands the definition of a crypto “broker,” and increases reporting requirements by those brokers to the IRS.</description>

  <title>Seven Charts That Explain the Current State of Crypto</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Vi5qBEpExoCmzEcDvF/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Coinbase Falters After Milestone Public Offering  On April 14, 2021, the crypto exchange Coinbase became the first major crypto company to go public in the US, in what many considered a watershed moment for the industry. What institutional investors see in crypto While they remain skeptical about whether crypto has any practical use, institutional investors increasingly think digital assets have a place in an investment portfolio. Producing bitcoin requires a lot of energy Cryptocurrency, and bitcoin specifically, is criticized over the huge amount of energy used in bitcoin mining (environmental concerns is why Elon Musk decided to stop allowing bitcoin payments for Tesla several months ago. Size of the crypto market Total cryptocurrency market capitalization, or the value of all cryptocurrencies in existence, peaked in May 2021 at about $2.4 trillion, up from around $200 billion in 2019.

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3DzwbT4oF52JG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to use the $28 billion raised through tighter crypto regulation to help pay for the infrastructure bill.

Most people who haven’t found a job that they are passionate about have stopped looking for one. Pick up a book on something you know nothing about (the Brew has a whole shelf full of recs). I don't like my current job but I have no idea what I would rather do instead. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds still don’t.”</description>

Fast fashion 2.0, known as “ultra-fast fashion” and popularized by brands like ASOS and Boohoo, got that process down to a week or two. Shein turns around a new design in as little as three days. As factory production gears up, Shein. If you’re not a Gen Z woman with a penchant for online shopping, you may have never heard of the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce company, Shein. If you are in that demographic, the brand likely follows you around the internet like an overly attached chihuahua. But moving this fast has resulted in Shein breaking things. An in-house design team then sends it to a Shein supplier located in China’s manufacturing hub, Guangzhou.</description>
