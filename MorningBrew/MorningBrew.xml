Since cannabis isn‚Äôt legal at the federal level, supply and demand at the state level has a greater influence on its price than on those of federally legal staples like gas, milk, and eggs. In fact, cannabis is relatively cheap across the board.</description>

It built its own financial messaging system in case it gets blocked from the one used around the world, called SWIFT. Geopolitical experts say that the types of sanctions being prepared, which could block Russia from importing critical tech materials or cut off Russian banks from accessing the US dollar, will be enough to overcome Putin‚Äôs defenses and cause significant and immediate damage to the Russian economy. And investors are preparing for the worst: Russia‚Äôs benchmark stock index closed down 11% yesterday for its biggest single-day drop since Russia‚Äôs annexation of Crimea in 2014. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeAs Russia eyes moving troops further into Ukraine, Western leaders are readying economic sanctions to punish Vladimir Putin for his aggression. US lawmakers have pledged to unleash the ‚Äúmother of all sanctions‚Äù in the event of a Russian invasion, and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggested on Sunday that the sanctions will include cutting off Russian companies from using US dollars and British pounds, hitting them ‚Äúvery, very hard.‚Äù Big picture: Despite the sanction-proofing campaign, Putin‚Äôs Fortress Russia is not impenetrable.

Obviously privacy is a huge thing for us and we have to make sure that we keep all of our users‚Äô data private. So one of those was the move to online dating. And it‚Äôs interactive, which is really effective in getting people to start a conversation. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeIn light of the West Elm Caleb drama and more instances of people sharing uncensored dating app profiles on TikTok and social media, what responsibility do dating apps have to protect users' privacy? I think people also just got more thoughtful and dated with more intention. People have talked about their dating lives forever, and people will continue to talk about their dating lives. I think it‚Äôs accelerated some trends that were happening in dating already. Biggest risk I‚Äôve ever taken‚Ä¶A tie between flying to Switzerland to ask my college girlfriend to call off her wedding and move back to America with me and deciding to reboot Hinge and start over. I think my peak weirdness is my obsession with ecstatic dance. Hinge added audio prompts in October; why do you think they were so popular? [The pandemic] made a lot of people reflect on their lives and think about what really mattered to them. And as a result, people got more intentional with their relationships, which I think made Hinge an especially attractive option for people. So it's about finding that sweet spot where you're giving people enough information that they can really get a sense of who you are, but not scaring people away from doing it. The other thing is people just want to be more sure before they meet up with someone in person. He launched the first version of the dating app Hinge in 2011 but, after a rocky few years, decided to scrap it and start over in 2015.</description>

Their conviction that consumer behavior would be forever changed by Covid led them to make poor decisions that dented future prospects. One might even suggest that the companies billed as pandemic winners are not only not winners, they are also losers. 2,800 job cuts, an 82% stock plunge, and one CEO later, it decided to scrap that idea. Roku is one of many companies whose epic rise in 2020 has been overshadowed by an equally epic collapse in the last year:Shopify, which represented the Covid e-commerce boom, is down 62% from its peak.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. It‚Äôs certainly true that Musk has ridiculed his own government to an extent we haven‚Äôt seen from a big-name CEO‚Ä¶maybe ever? The latest: Tesla yesterday accused the SEC, Wall Street‚Äôs top cop, of harassing Musk in order to ‚Äúchill‚Äù his right to free speech. ‚ÄúWorst of all,‚Äù it reads, ‚Äúthe SEC seems to be targeting Mr. Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr. Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government.‚Äù But now it‚Äôs reached a fever pitchLet‚Äôs go back to the letter Tesla sent to the SEC yesterday. In the years since, Musk and the SEC have escalated their beef, with the SEC telling Tesla that some of Musk‚Äôs tweets violated the agreement, and Musk flinging back schoolyard insults. The two sides reached an agreement that resulted in $40 million in fines, Musk having to leave his chairman position for three years, and a requirement that certain Musk tweets and other public statements get clearance from lawyers. ‚ÄîNF css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Musk‚Äôs critics say these comments are not only juvenile and offensive, but also hypocritical, given the billions in government subsidies his companies have received. The complaint stems from a 2018 settlement over Musk‚Äôs tweet that he had the ‚Äúfunding secured‚Äù to take Tesla private. It‚Äôs the third federal safety probe of Tesla in six months. Musk has been a frequent critic of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The SEC alleged that Musk broke securities law with that statement, because he wasn‚Äôt telling the truth.</description>
