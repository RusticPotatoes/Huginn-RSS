  <title>The Perfect Investment Does Not Exist</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2958/primary.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investing in the stock market can feel that way, too.   The market will always ebb and flow, but if you take a long term approach to investing with money you can afford to let sit and grow, the best time to start is still ASAP. Then use your time to stay informed on certain sectors, read up on quarterly earnings reports of big companies, and earmark that cash to invest the next time there’s a market downturn. The idea of perfect timing doesn’t apply to smart investing—leave that to boarding escalators and planning the perfect proposal. It’s human nature to plan for the perfect moment—be it proposing to your partner on a beach with an airplane banner, or landing the perfect step on an escalator at the mall.</description>
