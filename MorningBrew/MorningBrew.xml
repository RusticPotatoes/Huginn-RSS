Let’s talk about that rally  How it started: The Dow was in the dumps during the onset of the pandemic, trading below 19,000 points in March. Of course, each 10,000 point milestone represents a smaller proportional gain, because math.</description>

  <title>McKesson Will Be the Central Distributor of Covid-19 Vaccines</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3227/former_mckesson_chairman.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The company will not make decisions on where to send the vaccines, however.   Put me in, coach Through Operation Warp Speed, the government has made McKesson the central distributor of Covid-19 vaccines (outside of Pfizer-BioNTech’s, which needs to live in sub-Arctic temps).     Because of McKesson’s expertise in schlepping life-saving material, the country has tapped it for similar programs before. It’s a lucrative business.</description>

  <title>A Quick Teardown of Operation Warp Speed</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3228/operation_warp_speed.png'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Looking ahead...   Budget: Up to $18 billion.   The goal: To deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective vaccine by Jan. 2021. OWS leadership has said they can deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to every state less than 24 hours after FDA approval.</description>

  <title>How Temperature-Sensitive Vaccine Candidates Will be Distributed Via the Cold Chain</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/zoMno34V30kla/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Dry ice is the cold chain’s best friend. Pfizer has designed temperature-controlled dry ice boxes that can maintain a roughly -94° Fahrenheit temperature for up to 10 days.   Bottom line: Even with distributors and drug companies beefing up their cold chain capacity, pharma experts still expect a spoilage rate between 5% and 20%.   Storage is tight.</description>

  <title>One Vaccine Dose’s Journey From Lab to Arm</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/VTLkM7Z0a2I48/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  But not so fast: Moderna’s vaccine requires two doses 28 days apart. The vaccine will fly in those Elsa-approved containers to a McKesson distribution facility in Irving, TX. We just spit a lot of information at you about the vaccine supply chain.</description>

  <title>Vaccine Manufacturing 101: The Brew Breaks it Down</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3074/vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Vaccine manufacturing is Isla de Muerta  It’s an island that cannot be found, except by those who already know where it is.   Plus, it’s not cheap. The total costs of vaccine development can run up to $500 million, one study found.     Step 5: Distribution—mix up all the components in vials or syringes, load those suckers on trucks, and get them in some arms.   Step 3: Next, the antigen is purified through processes that sound like words you’d make up when lying about doing science homework: chromatography and ultrafiltration. Probably not, but Pfizer does. Basil’s gotta become pesto at some point. Scientists do this by literally growing it in a cell—like the basil plant on your window, but tiny.</description>

  <title>Report: President-Elect Biden Will Nominate Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3218/federal_reserve_chair_jan.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  What does a Treasury secretary even do? If confirmed, Yellen will become the first woman to lead the Treasury Department.   What else will be on her agenda? President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate the former Fed Chair as the next Treasury secretary, as first reported by the WSJ.   Of course, Yellen's first couple months will be preoccupied with one objective: putting this coronavirus-induced recession in the rearview. Biden said his Treasury secretary pick would please those across the political spectrum, and Yellen is it.</description>

  <title>The Theatrical Window Is Shrinking, Fast</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3191/home_theater.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Monday, Universal struck a landmark deal with theater chain Cinemark that allows it to debut a movie on premium streaming services just 31 days after it hits theaters.

  <title>Pfizer Applies for Emergency Use Authorization</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3074/vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  With vaccines, “emergency” is relative. If that’s approved, about 20 million Americans—likely healthcare workers and the elderly—could be immunized before the end of the year. Moderna, which reported a 94.5% effective vaccine, will be next to file an application.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3189/treasury_secretary_mnuchi.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s the rivalry no one asked for but we got because everything else is canceled.   Mnuchin: Nobody panic Mnuchin tried to calm down investors by doing an interview with someone who’s known for calming down investors: Jim Cramer. He said he’s made his pick, one who will be accepted by “all elements of the Democratic Party.” and there’s plenty of money available, should it be needed. But Thursday’s surprise announcement was one of the few times that politics may have weaseled into their relationship.</description>
