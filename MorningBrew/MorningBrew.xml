  <title>Biden Releases $2.3 Trillion Infrastructure Plan to Boost US Competitiveness and Combat Climate Change</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F781%2F1_train_in_nyc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biden will introduce Part 2 of his economic spending proposal in the next few weeks, called the American Family Plan. To help pay for it, Biden wants to bump up the corporate tax from 21% to 28% and close other tax loopholes. For the climate, the plan “would be the most far-reaching federal investment to date in programs that would help curb greenhouse gas emissions,” writes Axios. $400 billion to caregiving efforts for the elderly and those with disabilities.  $650 billion to improve your life at home, including investments in high-speed broadband and the electric grid.</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Writers Pick the Top Business News Story of Q1</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4567%2Fgamestop_stock_falls_more.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To me, that's what made GameStop mania the biggest story of the quarter—the broader financial world was forced to acknowledge the power of social media users to move markets. It feels like we're in the early stages of so many emerging crypto applications and I'm excited for what's to come.   I'm hopeful that, as the rollout continues, businesses will be able to operate at full throttle and we can tentatively start seeing what this hyped New Normal thing is all about. The US has done a really good job—as of Tuesday, about 15% of Americans are fully vaccinated and we're on pace to administer 200 million shots in Biden's first 100 days.</description>

  <title>Reader Q&amp;A: What Is Financial Leverage?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F14rfBl2RMAHtCM%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to borrow money to make purchases that, over time, can make you far more money than your initial capital could.  In the financial world, investors use the term "leverage" to refer to debt that's used to fund transactions. But while leverage can increase your reward, it can also increase risk, which is where the story of this hedge fund, Archegos Capital Management, comes in.  </description>

  <title>US Home Prices Hit 7-Year High</title>

Platforms like Cameo and Substack were already getting more popular as fans sought out a more direct connection with creators, but the pandemic made backstage content = all content.  Also in 2020, the similar-but-significantly-more-NSFW platform OnlyFans made $300 million in profit on $400 million in revenue, per The Information.</description>

  <title>Light Roast Is Dead, Long Live Sunday Edition</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2Fugair49WE2di0%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It will add a bunch of fresh sections to the Brew’s current lineup, including:A work advice columnAnalysis of a juicy news topicZillow surfingMeme contestInterviews with really cool peopleWhereas our daily newsletter is tied to the business news cycle like a tongue to a pole in winter, Sunday Edition will be free to roam and explore more general interest topics with a grounding in business. Sunday Edition will be available for everyone, which allows us to devote more resources to this newsletter and provide readers with top-tier content. But in the meantime, I want to share the basic structure of the new newsletter, give Light Roast a proper send-off, and explain why we decided to make the change.  Light Roast provided a fantastic space for us writers to connect with Brew readers on a more personal level, one that we will certainly miss. We are replacing Light Roast with a new reward.</description>

  <title>Germany Avoids “Baby Bust” With Rising Birth Rates</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4520%2Fbaby_in_hospital.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This jump in births runs counter to the current and even pre-pandemic fertility rates in the rest of Europe, the US, and other wealthy nations: There will be 300,000 fewer births this year in the US, according to estimates. No one’s totally sure, but some economists are pointing to Kurzarbeit, Germany’s state-funded safety net.</description>

  <title>Ever Given, the Ship Stuck in the Suez Canal, Has Been Partially Refloated</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4525%2Fship_stuck_in_suez_canal.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line: If the Ever Given can fully break free today and allow traffic to pass, the shipping industry can avoid the worst scarring, according to the NYT. You can get deep about it.  The Ever Given, a mind-bogglingly huge container ship that’s been blocking the Suez Canal for almost a week, holding up an estimated $9.6 billion in goods a day, is way less stuck than it used to be.   But that hasn’t stopped everyone from having a little fun at the ship’s expense—okay, a lot of fun. The moon.</description>

  <title>Wall Street Mystery Swirls Over Massive Block Trades</title>

Basically, what allegedly happened is that Archegos's lenders forced it to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares on Friday. In Saturday’s Brew, we noted that shares in Discovery and ViacomCBS had plunged on Friday following analyst downgrades.</description>

  <title>Why Morning Brew Added Bitcoin to the Markets Section</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F938%2Fbitcoin_bull.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think our Markets section will be more relevant to readers with bitcoin in it. It's simply a recognition that finance, just like anything else, is changing, and our newsletter should reflect that. Perhaps you just took a tequila shot out of happiness. In their place, we added 1) bitcoin and 2) a "flex" spot, which will allow us to showcase any security—whether it's a tech stock, oil, or dogecoin—that made an interesting move the previous day.</description>
