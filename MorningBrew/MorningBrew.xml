Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeIn remote Texas this morning, SpaceX will attempt the first orbital launch of its towering Starship system, the reusable space vehicle CEO Elon Musk says will be the key that unlocks trips to the moon and Mars and eventually turns humanity into a “multi-planet species.” Previous Starship test runs have ended in fiery explosions, and Musk has put the odds of Starship getting to orbit this morning at 50%. css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Everything about this launch pushes the limits of conventional space flight:Starship is made of stainless steel, which the space industry has typically shunned for its weight. Musk has acknowledged this flight might not go as planned. That could allow it to refuel on Mars, since the planet’s atmosphere contains trace amounts of the gas. Today at 8am ET, a two-and-a-half-hour launch window will open for Starship and the Super Heavy booster it’s mounted on.</description>

  <title>How AI can lower the costs of clinical trials</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/bfaed376e9e46b4c1dd6be5e731bb00b0b8775bd-7346x4900.jpg?rect=0,1,7346,4897&amp;w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. A reason a lot of healthy people choose to join Phase 1 clinical trials is the financial incentive, since you can make thousands of dollars from participating in a trial. AI can make it way easier to identify patients who meet the qualifications for a trial, mainly by sorting through massive troves of data that no human would be able to go through on their own, said Arun Bhatt, an independent clinical research and drug development consultant. One reason AI may not be used as much as it could is a lack of trust, Bhatt said. And therefore, I think clinical trials is one of the very, very last to come into this digital economy,” said Gallaher. We’re not here to weigh in on the likelihood of a future AI robot versus human apocalypse, but one thing we do know is that—when it comes to clinical trials—AI has the potential to do a lot of good. The median compensation for healthy volunteers in phase one clinical trials is $3,070, according to a 2021 study. Gallaher estimated that 10%-15% of trials use AI for recruitment. Opyl uses AI to identify potential trial participants via social media, Gallaher said. A lot of costs go into the recruitment phase. “Healthcare is one of the last industries to come to digital transformation. Opyl’s AI platform can identify that person as a potential participant for a clinical trial testing a new diabetes treatment. There are costs for marketing, so participants know there’s a trial to join. “Right now, the world can’t afford the medicines and the devices that are coming out,” said Michelle Gallaher, CEO of Opyl, which created an AI platform that’s used for trial recruitment. AI can quickly pinpoint who’s eligible for a trial, said Bhatt. Clinical trials are extremely expensive—they cost, on average, $700 million to $1 billion, according to Stefan Harrer, chief innovation officer at the Digital Health Cooperative Research Centre, an Australian investment fund and incubator for the digital health industry. In practice, not a lot of clinical trials are actually using AI yet, at least not for recruitment.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. It’s not an exaggeration to say that, currently in the US, Latin music is pop music. This song has been deemed so significant to American musical history that it was selected this week as one of 25 recordings and albums to be preserved in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress. One word: streaming. Streaming accounted for an eye-popping 97% of Latin music revenues last year. According to a report released by the Recording Industry Association of America on Wednesday, Latin music revenue surged 24% last year to hit a record high of $1.1 billion in the US. Big picture: With Daddy Yankee now retired from the music scene, Bad Bunny and a deep bench of emerging Latin artists are conquering the airwaves and reaching audiences Ricky Martin never could, thanks to the advent of streaming services. —NF Here, Bad Bunny is the GOAT: He’s been the most-streamed artist on Spotify globally for three straight years (18.5 billion streams in all). css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeOn Friday, Puerto Rican megastar Bad Bunny closed out the first day of Coachella—an appropriate finale to a landmark week for Latin music. Latin artists J. In introducing the once-underground reggaeton genre to the masses, Daddy Yankee walked so Bad Bunny could run. That’s the second straight year of double-digit gains and a bigger jump than any other music genre.</description>

Japan had one of the world’s strictest border controls during the pandemic and only reopened in October 2022 after two-and-a-half years of isolation. In 2022, the number of tourists plummeted to 4 million, compared to 32 million in 2019. Japan’s tourism industry could use the help because, unlike the Japanese national baseball team, it’s been struggling lately.</description>

A vanity plate with the letter-number combo “P7” sold for $15 million at a charity auction in Dubai last weekend, making it the most expensive license plate in the world.

Sometimes, you need to spend the most money on one of the smallest pieces of the car: the license plate. A vanity plate with the letter-number combo “P7” sold for $15 million at a charity auction in Dubai last weekend, making it the most expensive license plate in the world. The plate was part of the “Most Noble Numbers” auction and was likely popular because it looks like it just has a “7” on it. —MM</description>

The letter shot back that mifepristone “has been proven by decades of data to be safer than Tylenol, nearly all antibiotics and insulin.” This is about more than mifepristoneThe letter states that if courts can revoke drug approvals “without regard for science or evidence, or for the complexity required to fully vet the safety and efficacy of new drugs, any medicine is at risk for the same outcome as mifepristone.” The government has also asked for clarification on how it can follow a contradictory court ruling, issued by a federal judge in Washington state soon after the Texas ruling came down, that barred the FDA from making mifepristone harder to get in 17 states. But the legal battle is far from over…the DOJ has filed an appeal of Judge Kacsmaryk’s ruling and asked the appeals court to put an emergency hold on the decision before it is slated to take effect this Friday. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribePharma industry bigwigs are not fans of a Texas federal judge’s ruling last week invalidating the FDA’s decades-old approval of the abortion medication mifepristone—essentially banning its sale nationwide.</description>
