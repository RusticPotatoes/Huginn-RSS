Compare that to the more lax approach employed by countries like the US and the UK. Why it matters: Singapore is the most significant example yet of a country pivoting from a “Covid Zero” approach to a strategy that accepts Covid as “endemic,” meaning it’s always present but remains at a manageable level. “Living with Covid”Before its pivot, Singapore was part of a group of Asia-Pacific countries that played Whac-A-Mole to snuff out any trace of the coronavirus in an approach known as “Zero Covid.”</description>

  <title>Make It Work: I'm a Little Lost</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The first thing you should ask yourself is whether it’s a specific aspect of your current job that you dislike, or if it’s the line of work that you find unfulfilling. Most people who haven’t found a job that they are passionate about have stopped looking for one. Pick up a book on something you know nothing about (the Brew has a whole shelf full of recs). I don't like my current job but I have no idea what I would rather do instead. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds still don’t.”</description>

Fast fashion 2.0, known as “ultra-fast fashion” and popularized by brands like ASOS and Boohoo, got that process down to a week or two. Shein turns around a new design in as little as three days. As factory production gears up, Shein. If you’re not a Gen Z woman with a penchant for online shopping, you may have never heard of the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce company, Shein. If you are in that demographic, the brand likely follows you around the internet like an overly attached chihuahua. But moving this fast has resulted in Shein breaking things. An in-house design team then sends it to a Shein supplier located in China’s manufacturing hub, Guangzhou.</description>

I was in orchestra, I was the captain of my high school bowling team, and I loved Star Wars. Then, one day I was sitting at work at my office job and I opened my email and saw a note from Jeopardy! And then after many, many other things, I'm putting together social content.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6104%2Fmattel_barbie_dolls.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They all have Barbie dolls in their likenesses. Why it matters: Mattel had been criticized for depicting an unrealistic portrait of womanhood with its original white, blonde doll, which turned 60 in 2019.

  <title>SEC Chief Gary Gensler Calls Crypto the "Wild West" in Speech</title>

The market is worth about $1.6 trillion, Gensler said. Why does it matter what Gensler thinks?  But here’s something you may not know: Gensler is kind of a crypto nerd himself.  As the country’s top financial regulator, he could hand down the most significant rules for the crypto industry to date.</description>

  <title>So You Wanna Be a Cryptonaire</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6075%2Fcryptocurrency_wallet.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 14% of people in the US have crypto investments, according to crypto exchange Gemini, and the market is still a pea compared to the global stock and bond markets.   Cryptocurrency isn’t just bitcoin. If you want to invest in crypto or other assets, that’s fine and dandy. But if you’re looking to diversify your portfolio and put some money in a new asset class, do some research and try starting small. The bear case: There’s a lot of speculation happening in the crypto market, and while some cryptocurrencies post huge gains, they can also be incredibly volatile. which you should already have after setting your initial investment and retirement strategy. If you sell a crypto asset, use it to purchase goods/services, or trade it for another cryptocurrency, any profit you make is probably subject to a capital gains tax (which varies based on how long the asset is held).  Just please don’t put your life savings in dogecoin. Cryptocurrency can be the bulk of those riskier investments or just a slice—but it shouldn’t be the majority of your portfolio. For crypto novices, numerous financial advisors recommend starting off with a very small allocation (1%–2%) of your portfolio in crypto. The IRS taxes cryptocurrency transactions similarly to property.   Bottom line: Unlike pairing black socks with brown loafers, there isn’t a correct answer about whether you should invest in crypto today.</description>
