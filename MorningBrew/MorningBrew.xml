  <title>Why are dolphins guarding a Russian naval base?</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. The US jump-started its marine mammal military program in 1960, primarily employing bottlenose dolphins and sea lions to accomplish a variety of underwater tasks humans just don’t have the fins for. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeWe know a decent amount about the US’ use of marine mammals for military purposes after information was leaked about the program in 1992. Their most likely porpoise—sorry, purpose—is to defend Russian warships against enemy divers, serving as a crucial line of defense for what is Russia’s most important naval base on the Black Sea.While we can see you there looking shocked at the existence of a Russian dolphin infantry division…Marine mammals have a long history of military serviceAnd not just for the Russians. Dolphins’ skills were on display during the Iraq War in 2003. Big picture: Over time, humans have become a lot more skilled at leveraging marine mammals to win wars.</description>

  <title>When a dog-sitting gig turns into an awkward conversation with your boss</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. A key question I have is whether your boss is aware of your side hustle. I dog-sit as a side hustle, so I happily obliged when he asked if I was free. The first of the month is traditionally a big day for bones: Some of us owe them, others collect them, and a hip-hop group that bears the name gave us an iconic 90s track to help mark the calendar. What should I do? Anything nagging at you? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! My boss has a new puppy and needed someone to watch her for the weekend. Is it possible your boss was simply biding his time so that he could wake up and settle his debts with the rest of us today? Share your workplace conundrum with Make It Work here. Probably not, so let’s work out your best move here. I feel awkward asking, especially since he’s my boss, but I deserve to be paid for the work I did. Ask Shane here. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeEach week, our workplace whisperer Shane Loughnane answers a reader-submitted question about problems at work.</description>

So that’s when it’s a problem: when we say we’re going to do one thing and yet we’re doing something else. What I want to cater to is the person who’s like me: I would be the kind of person who said I’d do one thing and I do something else. I would say I’m going to be fully present with people I love, and yet I used my phone as opposed to being really there for my daughter and my wife. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}.</description>

One of blockchain technology’s big promises is enhanced security, but so far its track record is muddier than a Dirty Jobs episode. —JW But there’s a trade-off: Ronin is less secure than the blockchain it supports. According to a post from Ronin yesterday, most of the stolen funds are still sitting in that wallet, and Ronin is working 25/7 with regulators to get them back. In this case, hacker(s) took control of enough of the “nodes” that greenlight transactions on Ronin to funnel money into their own ethereum wallet. Because Ronin is off-chain, its transactions are faster, cheaper, and less energy intensive than on-chain ones.</description>

  <title>Thousands of Verizon users received scam texts from themselves</title>

While I didn’t click the link included in my text to myself, The Verge reported that it would have gone to the Russian state media network Channel One Russia, which feels like an odd gift tbh. Verizon has begun working with the FBI and the Secret Service to identify the source of the apparent phishing attempt, adding that, “virtually all wireless providers have faced similar fraudulent activity in recent months.” —MK Zoom out: The FTC received more than 375,000 reports of text message fraud in 2021—with losses for link-clickers totalling $131 million. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeOn Monday, I (Max) received a text message from myself offering some good news: I’d paid my bill for March and, as a treat, I was sending myself a “little gift” for my troubles. According to Verizon, thousands of users have received similar texts from themselves—apparently the work of “bad actors.”</description>

  <title>So, you want to take your paycheck in bitcoin?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/staging/87048d816e4666cccd98872c2ec2377cf9b887ec-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On payday, the crypto software company, which requires all the employees to be paid in bitcoin, exchanges an employee’s wage from US dollars to bitcoin and sends it to the employee’s crypto wallet. But the digital infrastructure still needs to catch up so Adams can use his crypto to pay for the subway or Suarez can pay for cafecito. But Richardson and Adams aren’t living paycheck to paycheck: They operate on the higher end of the risk spectrum and don’t need to liquidate their crypto checks immediately to buy groceries or pay rent. If an employee is paid right after a market pullback and the crypto loses a substantial portion of value, a disgruntled employee could argue the employer violated minimum wage laws. Despite all the headlines about celebrities taking their pay in cryptocurrencies, there isn’t much one can do with the crypto check. Richardson said his loss “sucks” but added, “I can afford to do that.” Adams also lost money during the crypto market crash. Until that happens, a bitcoin paycheck isn’t the most practical option. To get technical, Adams, Suarez, and Richardson aren’t actually being paid in bitcoin or ethereum. Exodus employee Allysa Howell chooses to convert 90% of her bitcoin paycheck to dollars within 24 hours of payday. Adams had to get creative and convert his salary into bitcoin and ethereum by using Coinbase. So he didn’t cash any of his crypto paycheck. With such big names backing bitcoin paychecks, they’re officially a trend. Upstream currently doesn’t pay employees in crypto. Exodus provides a 3–5% buffer to account for volatility of bitcoin price and exchange fees, but it’s common for bitcoin to increase or decrease in price by 5% or even 10% on any given day. Getting paid in bitcoin isn’t for everyone. Fisher Phillips’s Bauknight warns that paying employees in bitcoin is a gray area. Unlike Exodus, the New York City government doesn’t own any bitcoins and it isn’t allowed to pay workers in cryptocurrency.</description>

  <title>Zwift's push into competitive cycling could change esports</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/staging/afd090ad69ca85f7f23399bed20e884067612a42-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. “That's really the reason I'm able to still compete at this level at all,” she said of Zwift’s flexibility. During the pandemic it began hosting its most serious competitions, including a modified, remote version of the Tour de France in 2020 where both men and women could compete in separate races. )Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Through those races, she became a promising e-racer and competed in Zwift’s USA Cycling series before joining the first world championship race on Zwift in 2020. Nearly 10,000 people watched the race live on YouTube as Loes Adegeest of the Netherlands crossed the finish line to win the Zwift women’s championship race. Shayna Powless, one of the Team USA cyclists, said she started using Zwift to train indoors. “I suffer more during Zwift races than I do in real life races for the most part, just because in Zwift racing, it's kind of all out from start to finish,” she said. The cyclists began the 55-kilometer race in Central Park, packed so tightly together it was sometimes hard for spectators to read the countries written across the back of their jerseys. But Zwift is a little bit different—although Fortnite and Zwift players might compete from their bedrooms, the app occupies the niche between a physical sport and a video game. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. The fans and the course were digitally rendered, and the cyclists were avatars representing the world’s most talented e-cyclists. Godbe said she hopes that e-cycling is gaining legitimacy, but it’s still early. Like other road races, Zwift is still a team sport, Matt Gardiner, an esports director with USA Cycling, told Morning Brew. They even replicated one of the race’s toughest climbs up Mont Ventoux. Men and women raced equal distances in two separate heats on the same course, each hoping to win a rainbow world champion jersey–a digital version for their avatars and a physical one for them–and 8,000, 4,000, or 2,000 euros for placing first, second, or third, respectively. ) It’s also created new stars from its pool of riders. They were competing in February 26’s Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) Cycling Esports World Championship title on Zwift, a part-gaming, part-fitness platform that allows people to race on stationary bikes from their homes. Zwift itself has been a metaverse company since its inception, although its creators didn’t initially use that word to describe it, Snook said. As of 2021, the global esports market was worth more than $1 billion, according to Statista, and the worldwide esports audience had reached 474 million people. They can also purchase smart bikes directly from Zwift for around $3,000.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with…business legend Indra Nooyi</title>

Do you feel driven by the high expectations placed on you by the Indian and Indian American communities, or have you been able to focus on what is actually best for Indra? One of the lessons I’ve learned is to watch the communication style of people two levels above me, because that told me how people got to where they are. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Indra Nooyi, the former chair and CEO of PepsiCo, is widely considered one of the most powerful women in corporate America—for her business prowess, certainly, but also for showing how to balance a demanding job with a fulfilling family life.
