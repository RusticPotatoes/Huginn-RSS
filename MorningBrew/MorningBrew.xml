Work outside of the homeAttend schoolLeave home without a male escort and their faces and bodies coveredSince the US ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, Afghan women made gains in education and the workforce. An estimated 1.6 million more Afghan women are employed now over 20 years ago. Five Mediterranean nations have requested EU-level talks about how to respond.  Washington Post publisher Fred Ryan pleaded with the White House to protect more than 200 journalists, staffers, and family members from the WaPo, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal who were in danger at the airport.</description>

Hundreds of Afghan civilians clung to the sides of a US military aircraft as it took flight in hopes of fleeing the country following the Taliban takeover.   Since the US ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, Afghan women made gains in the workforce and in education.  One of those signs: Female employees at banks are reportedly being told to stay home and that male relatives could take over their duties.</description>

  <title>Everything you’ve wondered about crypto (but were too embarrassed to ask)</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1671%2Fbull_with_crypto.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  That’s why governments aren’t sure what to do with them... )How much is crypto worth? Think of it like Chuck E.  If you can’t buy much stuff with it, why is so much money parked in it? That’s why a Dockers-wearing, old-school financial adviser might tell you to just not go there... That’s because crypto is virtual, not physical, meaning a token IRL looks like a very long and inscrutable string of numbers and letters. If you want to get involved, just do a lot of reading so you understand what you’re getting into. There are definitely crypto connoisseurs out there—they make themselves known, especially on social media—but this article isn’t for them. Even the name of bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto is widely believed to be a pseudonym. Bitcoin alone is currently valued at more than $875 billion, or about $46,552 per token. In April, the category topped $2 trillion for the first time, and as of this writing it’s hovering around there again. That baffling string refers to a bunch of transactions that took place on the blockchain. Musk is feeling on that particular day.</description>

Big picture: Since the US invasion in 2001, more than 47,000 Afghan civilians and nearly 2,500 US troops have died in the conflict. The US-trained Afghan military was easily overwhelmed by the Taliban’s advance in a matter of weeks.   A few noticeable improvements in Afghanistan over the past two decades include increased life expectancy (56 years → 64) and a jump in the literacy rate (rising 8%, to 43%).</description>

  <title>NYC Begins Requiring Proof of Vaccination for Entrance to Indoor Venues</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2370%2Fnew_york_city.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;San Francisco is rolling out its vax mandates on Friday, which are even stricter than New York’s in that they require proof of full vaccination to enter many indoor businesses. It’s all the more urgent considering consumer confidence plunged to its lowest level since 2011 in July.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: Taking the Plunge on a House</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ir9ooRoyKZY8pRCJze/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Owning a home can make for a great investment. However, just because you can buy a house doesn’t mean you’re ready. For some, it’s much more appealing to rent so that you can dial up a landlord when your AC unit freezes over (not speaking from experience). Oh, and some more cash for a down payment—somewhere between 5% and 20% of the purchase price.</description>

Offices are still empty: 75% of respondents are working fully remote, while 20% head in a few times a week. But they like working from home: 66% of readers said working from home during the pandemic was better than expected.</description>

The dive was primarily sparked by concerns surrounding the Delta variant. It’s not just consumers going blue.</description>

  <title>The Taliban Is Taking Over Afghanistan and Its Drug Trade</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6238%2Fafghanistan_jump-starts_a.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Taliban now effectively controls all of southern Afghanistan, and US officials told the NYT that the Biden administration is preparing for the possibility of the Afghan government collapsing within the next month. The Taliban has also started peddling meth recently. But the Taliban didn’t just beef up its drug supply. Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer of opium, which most heroin is derived from: 84% of all the world’s opium was sourced from the country from 2015–20, per the UN’s World Drug Report.  Bottom line: The Taliban’s power grab likely means more heroin and meth will be pushed into the hands of dealers and users around the world.</description>

  <title>The New Office Small-Talk: Are You Vaccinated?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4816%2Fvaccine_dartboard.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Colleagues are now spilling the beans about their vaccination experience and showing off their proof of vaccination on social media.  Although the spread of the Delta variant has injected new uncertainties into return-to-work plans, many execs, who have called remote work “an aberration” and not for young people “who want to hustle,” are intent on bringing employees back to the office—or have done so already. They cited the newness of the vaccine and possible side effects as the reasons for their vaccine hesitancy.  Morgan, the HR consultant, said it was natural for people to talk about the pandemic and the vaccine with their coworkers, but HR should remind them “to be respectful and civil toward each other, regardless of vaccination status.” But can employers require their workers to be vaccinated? “I have all of my other vaccines and have gotten the flu shots most years,” Michelle said. Unvaccinated workers were required to wear masks all the time outside of their cubes, while the vaccinated were free to drop them. If my work mandates it, I don’t know what I’ll do,” Michelle said. Not getting a vaccine =/= being an “anti-vaxxer” In a June survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 10% of American adults said they would “wait and see” before getting vaccinated, 6% would get inoculated only if required, while 14% would definitely not get the vaccine. Google, Facebook and Target have reinstituted mask mandates regardless of vaccination status. Michelle recalled that a coworker at a return-to-work meeting yelled, “What if I sit in a chair that was previously occupied by an unvaccinated person and bring back the virus to my kid?” That’s because Michelle, who chose to stay anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, has chosen to not yet get vaccinated against Covid-19. If they have both vaccinated and unvaccinated workers in the office, companies might need to enforce two different sets of policies. “It'd be way easier to just get the jab, but I would prefer to see long-term impacts and more data on side effects for people with my medical history,” she said.  Both Michelle and Monica are in the “wait-and-see” group.  “I’ve always thought that maybe in the future [I will get vaccinated] as more time passes and more is known,” Michelle said. The employer trusts employees to accurately report their vaccination status.</description>

One of the many ramifications of the Taliban’s onslaught: It could pour fuel on the illegal drug market. Afghanistan is the world's biggest producer of opium, which most heroin is derived from: 84% of all the world’s opium was sourced from the country from 2015–20, per the UN’s World Drug Report.  Bottom line: The Taliban’s power grab likely means more heroin and meth will be pushed into the hands of dealers and users around the world.</description>

  <title>Gym Rats are Bullish on In-Person Workouts, but Trends Point to a More Hybrid Future</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6234%2Fgym.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How’d these gyms make it? Planet Fitness increased revenue 241% last quarter compared to 2020, and added 700k new members. Cycling studio Flywheel filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September (meaning liquidation) while YogaWorks, Gold’s Gym, 24 Hour Fitness, as well as the parent company of New York Sports Clubs and Boston Sports Clubs all closed hundreds of locations across the US and filed for Chapter 11 (restructuring), citing pandemic-related problems. Even if we avoid another massive lockdown, most data points to in-home fitness sticking around and coexisting with gyms. 70% of online fitness program users plan to keep using them post-pandemic, per McKinsey. Planet Fitness CEO Chris Rondeau told CNBC this week that about 150 clubs currently require masks in accordance with local guidelines, but he hopes that the mandates are short-lived.</description>

Each week, our workplace whisperer Shane Loughnane answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. It's possible that since this is my first real job I am unable to identify problem areas, but I want to be better at identifying issues and communicating them.   Until then, take some advice from business sage Billy Madison: “Stay here.   It’s quite possible to simply find yourself in a great job situation that also happens to be the right fit at the right time in your career. Got any advice? Dang, you almost talked me into it.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with...Olympic Champion Surfer Carissa Moore</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6233%2Faround_the_games_-_olympi.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I’ve been on a surf trip here but it was over 10 years ago, and I have some of the best memories from surfing this spot. What’s the world of competitive surfing like? In Tokyo, Hawaii native Carissa Moore won the gold medal for the US in surfing’s first ever Olympics. But being conscious of and in tune with your own mental health, not being afraid to ask for help, and taking the time you need to feel through that space is super important. If you could compete at any surf spot around the world, what would it be? I hope it opens up surfing to a broader audience and can bring more people in, whether that's by inspiring someone to try surfing for the first time, or motivating them to choose their own path.</description>
