In the meantime, one of the study‚Äôs authors, Dr. Stanley Hazen, is telling his patients to skip the sweetener and opt for a couple of drops of honey or a pinch of sugar instead. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeA recent study published in Nature Medicine found that the sugar alternative erythritol is associated with an increased risk of heart issues and strokes. ‚ÄîSK It‚Äôs also unclear how worried folks without medical conditions should be, as the study mostly followed a population already prone to heart disease (due to conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure). While erythritol is linked to health issues, it does not necessarily cause them. Erythritol was also tied to an increased risk of blood clots in mice and human blood samples. Scientists explored the link between levels of different chemicals in the blood and the risk of heart disease. What did the study find?</description>

Zoom out: The last big merger in the airline industry happened in 2016 when Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe Biden administration is continuing its full-court press against airline consolidation.

  <title>This company discovered a (disc) diamond in the rough</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1525375b2d7712c264d1721d58053bf3a7b67200-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They generally look to companies like Dymicron for these solutions so they can partner or acquire to distribute them. Learn more about investing in their disc replacements. The Triadyme¬Æ-C implant eliminates the primary long-term issue with traditional disc replacements: wear debris. So, how many carats are in each disc replacement? Using a tri-lobe design, this artificial disc is molded from human-made diamond that never wears out (üíé really are forever). The Triadyme¬Æ-C disc replacement shows powerful potential: It‚Äôs already available outside the US and on its way to FDA approval stateside. No other disc on the market can provide this combination of zero wear debris and the exceptional biomechanics that our innovative tri-lobe design offers. And that‚Äôs a diamond worth noticing. But beyond that, additional degeneration can develop if the motion of an artificial disc doesn‚Äôt closely align with a patient‚Äôs natural movement. Now we can generate a whole new fan base of people and bring on investors who can help us solve the problem of degenerative disc disease. How do Dymicron‚Äôs discs improve the patient experience? You can help Dymicron bring this solution to those in need. That‚Äôs the exciting part of what the SEC and Congress have done with the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. It created equity crowdfunding opportunities so we can raise capital through interested retail investors.</description>

It‚Äôs also elevating the risk of clear-air turbulence, which appears out of the blue and gives pilots little time to order passengers to buckle up. Only 146 people were seriously injured by severe turbulence between 2009 and 2021, per the Federal Aviation Administration‚Äîand most were not wearing their seatbelts. ‚ÄîSK Airplanes are designed to withstand intense shaking, while pilots are trained to safely navigate intense wind‚Ä¶even if your plane meatloaf sticks to the aircraft ceiling. Are the skies becoming more treacherous? Last week alone, turbulence was responsible for: at least seven injuries aboard a transatlantic Lufthansa red-eye, the aborted landing of a North Carolina-bound Southwest flight, and a passenger death on a business jet traveling between New Hampshire and Virginia. css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Extreme turbulence is still very rare and not usually dangerous. But in general, you should still be more concerned about the prospect of a canceled flight than a shaky one.</description>

Walgreens, the second-largest pharmacy chain in the US, said it would work to become one of those pharmacies but quickly saw pushback from anti-abortion lawmakers. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeWalgreens said Thursday that it will not distribute abortion pills in 20 states, including several where abortion is legal. ‚ÄîMM Medication abortions account for more than half of all legal abortions in the US, and mifepristone is part of a popular two-drug protocol. So now, the company says it won‚Äôt sell the pills in those states, either in its stores or by mail, even though the FDA also said mifepristone could be mailed to states with abortion bans.</description>

And it‚Äôs just one of the many ominous signs for the commercial real estate market since people no longer go into the office every workday. The company has put an indefinite hold on breaking ground for the swanky office park known as PenPlace, which would encompass three 22-story towers and a sleek helix-shaped building. ‚ÄîSK The company is also reducing its physical footprint elsewhere. And headcount is unlikely to skyrocket any time soon: Amazon began laying off 18,000 employees in January (the steepest job cuts in its history). But for now, it‚Äôs not short on office space: Its employees still spend a lot of time working from home, even after a recent companywide mandate required them to return to the office three days a week. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeAmazon‚Äôs HQ2 is starting to look more like HQ1.5. Other Big Tech companies like Meta and Twitter have also slimmed down their real estate footprint to save money. Earlier this year, it vacated an office tower in its hometown, Seattle.</description>

And while overall ChatGPT adoption is low on college campuses, it has gained power users. 56% of respondents who haven‚Äôt used ChatGPT said the primary reason why is that they‚Äôve not had a use for it. 25% of the students who‚Äôve used ChatGPT have it bookmarked on their web browser. And the students who said they do fire up ChatGPT‚Ä¶don‚Äôt use it all that much, as 55% of respondents who said they‚Äôve used ChatGPT do so ‚Äúalmost never.‚Äù Uses for ChatGPTAmong the students who do use ChatGPT‚Ä¶what are they using it for? For giggles: 71% of students who‚Äôve used ChatGPT said they use it in part for entertainment or just for fun. 17% of students who‚Äôve heard of ChatGPT said they have direct knowledge of friends using ChatGPT to cheat. Of course, ChatGPT was released just a few months ago‚Äîso in a sense it is also quite remarkable that 60% of college students have heard of it. In our poll, the majority said no, but it‚Äôs still notable that 20% of students who‚Äôve heard of ChatGPT said the chatbot has influenced their career thinking.

And while overall ChatGPT adoption is low on college campuses, it has gained power users. 56% of respondents who haven‚Äôt used ChatGPT said the primary reason why is that they‚Äôve not had a use for it. 25% of the students who‚Äôve used ChatGPT have it bookmarked on their web browser. And the students who said they do fire up ChatGPT‚Ä¶don‚Äôt use it all that much, as 55% of respondents who said they‚Äôve used ChatGPT do so ‚Äúalmost never.‚Äù Uses for ChatGPTAmong the students who do use ChatGPT‚Ä¶what are they using it for? For giggles: 71% of students who‚Äôve used ChatGPT said they use it in part for entertainment or just for fun. 17% of students who‚Äôve heard of ChatGPT said they have direct knowledge of friends using ChatGPT to cheat. Of course, ChatGPT was released just a few months ago‚Äîso in a sense it is also quite remarkable that 60% of college students have heard of it. In our poll, the majority said no, but it‚Äôs still notable that 20% of students who‚Äôve heard of ChatGPT said the chatbot has influenced their career thinking. As Google: 32% of students who‚Äôve used ChatGPT said they use it in part for quick answers to simple questions, and 31% to understand complex topics. So, why aren‚Äôt college students using ChatGPT? For‚Ä¶cheating? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>

  <title>Gov‚Äôt cash for chipmakers comes with contentious strings attached</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. The Biden administration appears to be using the CHIPS and Science Act to kill an entire flock of birds with one stone. One policy think tank called the childcare requirement ‚Äúa pragmatic move‚Äù since it‚Äôll help companies recruit women amid a shortage of affordable childcare. He warns that the Biden administration infusing the program with social goals will raise costs for chip manufacturers. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told Morning Brew that workforce considerations are just one part of the holistic process for doling out funding, which gives ‚Äúmost weight‚Äù in an application to ‚Äúnational and economic security.‚Äù The law aims to spur semiconductor manufacturing in the US, but its $39 billion subsidy program, which the Commerce Department presented this week, puts strict conditions on companies looking to access the funds. The Commerce Department will take companies‚Äô willingness to refrain from stock buybacks into account, and some recipients of federal cash will have to share windfall profits with the government. The WSJ‚Äôs Chief Economics Commentator Greg Ip called the requirements ‚Äúmission creep‚Äù and argued that they might undercut the competitiveness of the US chips subsidies, noting that Canada, the EU, and Japan are also offering cash to lure in chipmakers. ‚ÄîSK Chips vs. The Commerce Department says the rules will help create the ‚Äúlarge, skilled, and diverse workforce‚Äù that companies need to churn out chips. childcare: what critics are sayingCritics have dubbed the Biden Administration‚Äôs implementation of the CHIPS Act ‚Äúindustrial social policy,‚Äù contending that it‚Äôs a Trojan horse for progressive measures unrelated to the main purpose of the program: making the US into a major chip producer.</description>

  <title>BriAnna Garza can teach you how to shoot a basketball</title>

Kyrie Irving is excellent at his free throws because he‚Äôs able to get into a kind of spiritual place. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. What‚Äôs the one thing amateur basketball players should work on in the gym to improve their shot? Last year I did a six-month study of watching every single catch-and-shoot in the NBA with 33,000 data points. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. The free throw is so strange because there‚Äôs no other shot in basketball like it. How do you coach free throws and how much is mental over technique? So no one shot is going to look exactly the same. If you‚Äôre gonna work on one thing, get that down. And there‚Äôs a reason Garza thinks deeply about basketball shots‚Äîshe makes a living from doing it.</description>
