  <title>How to File Your Taxes as an LLC</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4182%2Ftaxe_time.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, maybe an E (real estate, royalties, and other stuff), or an F (farmers, what’s up).  Now, there are a couple ways to file as an LLC: If you’re a single-member LLC (you own the business, and only you) and you’re filing as an individual, you’ll report your income and expenses on a 1040 (individual income tax return) and a Schedule C (profit or loss from an unincorporated business).  If you have employees, you’ll file separately from a 1040 or 1065: Estimated Tax: 1040-ESSocial Security, Medicare, and Income Tax Withholding: 941, 943, 944 More Info on Social Security, Medicare, and Income Tax Withholding: W-2, W-3 Federal Unemployment (FUTA) Tax: 940 You may also need to work through issues like information returns (payments to and transactions with non-employees) and excise taxes (taxes paid on certain goods, like gas). Or you simply like to decompress with a weighted blanket and some tax documents?</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Style Blog, No. 8: How to Kill Your Darlings</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FTXRHoV5Dvv7cA%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Maybe that reads a little blunt.  Then, you can go through the process described in No. 1; if the draft you write to your college roommate Dan feels too casual, you can zhuzh it up. That’s why editors are essential And I’m not just saying that because it’s review season and my editor decides whether I get a raise. Your best editor can be (and often is) a friend or family member—often, the person who’s most brutally honest about your outfits is your best editor. The magic of a good editor is that she can filter all the unneeded stuff gumming up your sentences without compromising your voice. If you feel it’s too much, you can add back a few fluffy descriptors, or maybe even Jeffrey’s name. And because we love making things way more morbid than they need to be, news folks call the process of removing excess verbiage “killing your darlings,” and sometimes even—sorry—“killing babies.”</description>

  <title>What Is Market Capitalization?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2334%2Fstocks_declining.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worth noting: Market cap =/= how much it costs to buy a company.  Ask us something else here.  Tesla is the leading EV producer, and legacy automakers and EV startups are largely playing catch up. Brew's answer: Market capitalization, aka "market cap," is a measure of a public company's worth based on the dollar value of outstanding shares.</description>

  <title>Should You Be Worried About Inflation? Short Answer: Probably Not</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Indicators of inflation usually show up in the job market; when it overheats, inflation can start to snowball.    Tech shares in the US and Europe have slumped in anticipation of potential interest rate hikes, a move central banks might make to keep inflation at bay. But many economists say there's no need to worry Including the ones who actually oversee the economy. But the current job market is like the frozen burrito you threw in the microwave—hot on the surface (high yearly wage growth), but icy at the core (elevated unemployment claims).</description>
