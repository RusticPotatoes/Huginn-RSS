  <title>Google Commits to Phasing Out Invasive Third-Party Cookies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4244%2Fgoogle_cookie_jar.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That way, businesses can still serve targeted ads, but your specific user data is a little more private since Google is essentially hiding it in a crowd. To a certain extent, the modern advertising businesses of internet giants like Google and Facebook are built on the buttery backs of cookies. Google confirmed yesterday that it plans to phase out the practice of letting companies track users across the web using cookies by next year.</description>

Now that the wage increase is out, a handful of moderate Democrats who were skeptical of it are more likely to support the bill. If it passes, the House will need to vote again on a matching version.   </description>

  <title>Buy-Now-Pay-Later Giant Klarna Worth $31B After Latest Round of Funding</title>

Companies like Macy's and Neiman Marcus still rely heavily on store- and co-branded credit card fees to pad their bottom lines, offerings that compete with BNPL options.  One of the earliest companies to the BNPL game, Klarna offers consumers the option to pay for an item online in installments rather than all at once.  But BNPL has put retail giants in a pickle.  That concerns regulators, since more than than 10% of customers at one bank that had used BNPL were already behind on their payments, according to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett Releases Annual Shareholder Letter and Berkshire Hathaway Earnings</title>

Berkshire also bought back almost $25 billion of its own stock last year, reducing the total number of outstanding shares and increasing current investors’ ownership.  Looking ahead...  But notice what isn’t there: the pandemic, racial justice protests, the election, GameStop, and crypto. “There has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America.”</description>

Following Khashoggi’s murder in 2018, corporate America tried to distance itself from the kingdom by skipping the buzzy “Davos in the Desert” investment conference held in the Saudi capital, Riyadh. Khashoggi’s killing drew outrage from the international media and US lawmakers, and investigations zeroed in on the role of Mohammed bin Salman (MBS), the 35-year-old de facto ruler of the kingdom.   </description>
