  <title>Make It Work: How to Get Honest Feedback?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last thing you want is an employee who, in a final twist of irony, provides their only honest feedback during the exit interview.  Have a question about work you want to ask Shane? The number of managers who view feedback as a one-way street would make NYC’s grid blush. Do you have any advice for soliciting honest feedback? I had a manager who would ask during every 1-1 session if I had any feedback for them, a tactic I later found myself using with a few of my direct reports. The honest feedback comes to me and then I address it here on Sunday—what gives?  I’ve found the best strategy for collecting feedback from employees to be a diversified one. Write in here. Ask Shane here. Be one of the first subscribers to our upcoming newsletter on all things human resources.</description>

  <title>Nabisco Workers Strike Could Cause Supply Issues</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7267%2Fmondelez_product_collection.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Workers want their pensions back after the company switched to a 401(k) plan in 2018. Grocery stores are stocking up on Nabisco treats because of a production slowdown at bakeries and distribution facilities around the country. Zoom out: Workers have been gaining leverage in a labor market where qualified employees are hard to find.</description>

  <title>'Shang-Chi' May Not Get a Release Date in China</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7266%2Fshang-chi.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China was the second-largest box office in the world before the pandemic, and Chinese moviegoers are big Marvel fans: 22% of ticket sales for 2019’s Avengers: Endgame came from China. Bottom line: Shang-Chi isn’t the only upcoming Marvel film having trouble getting past the bouncer in China.</description>

  <title>Floods, Fires Increase Urgency to Upgrade Infrastructure Preparedness in US</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7264%2Fremnants_of_hurricane_ida.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isn’t there an infrastructure bill in the works? – NF Hurricane Ida left 1 million Louisiana households and businesses without power earlier in the week, then on Wednesday dumped its leftovers on the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. It contains $46 billion for building resilience against disasters, and advocates say the bill is crucial to beef up the US’ climate defenses.  Looking ahead... The new levees successfully fended off the worst of Ida on Sunday. Yep, a bipartisan plan passed the Senate this summer.   And we haven’t even mentioned the fires blazing out West, which are also exposing the weaknesses of California’s grid.</description>

Zoom out: The strike comes at a time when workers are gaining leverage due to labor shortages, but also when business has been particularly good for snack food companies like Mondelez, which reported net revenue growth of  2.8% in 2020 over the previous year.</description>

  <title>Strictest Abortion Law in the Country Goes Into Effect in Texas </title>

  <title>Strictest Abortion Law in the Country Goes Into Effect in Texas </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6481%2Ftexas_house_republicans_r.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;while it’s so far stayed quiet on the Texas law, the Supreme Court—now with a 6–3 conservative majority—will hear a major abortion case in the fall over Mississippi’s request to enforce an abortion ban 15 weeks after pregnancy begins.  It is the most restrictive abortion law in the country and could lead many abortion providers to shut their doors. “The lawsuits would be against the individuals making money off of the abortion, the abortion industry itself.” This law threatens my livelihood,” Dr. Ghazaleh Moayedi, an OB-GYN and abortion provider in Texas, told NPR.</description>

But more realistically, pick one. and Maddie will be like, “Do you mean Lara?” Make sure your 401(k) is in a good spot and consider opening a Roth IRA before Mercury goes into retrograde. That can only mean one thing: gold. Like, real gold is metal, it must stick to a magnet. Either way, use caution and wear sunscreen. Taurus: (April 20–May 20)Little known fact: NFT actually stands for Now Flirt with a Taurus. ] Virgo: (August 23–September 22)This month, you’ll get the gift you had your eye on, find ten bucks on the street, and your nemesis will have a setback at work. Remember, you only have 86,400 seconds in the day that you can’t get back. Wait, gold is magnetic, right? More like Econo-you-and-me.” That’s right, find an artist you like-like, ask them about NFTs, and watch the sparks fly. Let’s get into your September horoscopes.

  <title>Allbirds Becomes Latest DTC Startup to Make a Run at the Public Markets</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6460%2Fallbirds_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Allbirds and Warby Parker are just a couple wildebeests in a bigger stampede of consumer-facing companies headed to the public markets.  Both Allbirds and Warby Parker successfully leveraged online channels to attract urban millennials comfortable with buying apparel on the internet. Warby is also ditching the classic IPO playbook by going public via direct listing, which means it’s not actually going to raise any money in the process.  Sounds familiarIn that way, and in many others, it’s similar to Warby Parker, the e-commerce eyewear seller that filed to go public last week.</description>

  <title>What You Need to Know About Elizabeth Holmes’s Trial That Starts Today</title>

Jury selection begins today for the criminal fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of shuttered Silicon Valley biotech startup Theranos. Holmes’s net worth also grew to $4.5 billion, good enough for No. 1 on the Forbes list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women. From there, investors started suing for fraud, the government yanked the company’s blood-testing license, and in September 2018, the SEC dissolved Theranos. — MM</description>

Holmes’s net worth also grew to $4.5 billion, good enough for No. 1 on the Forbes list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women. Fall into a Theranos rabbit hole: The WSJ reporter who broke the story, John Carreyrou, wrote a riveting book about the fraud called Bad Blood. The downfall of Theranos may have briefly scared investors into looking closer at pitch decks, but it may take more than a conviction to change the Valley’s entrenched “fake it ’til you make it” mindset. Balwani’s lawyers called the claims “deeply offensive.”</description>
