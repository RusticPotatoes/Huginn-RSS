The report revealed that Harvard directly profited from slavery for centuries as it became America’s preeminent university. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeFollowing a substantial report detailing its historical ties to slavery, segregation, and discrimination, Harvard University announced yesterday that it will commit $100 million to further study and redress those ties. The report’s authors—a committee of Harvard faculty members—made a series of recommendations to work as a foundation to redress the institution’s legacy. Among its other findings:More than 70 Black and Native American people were enslaved by Harvard faculty and staff between 1636 and 1783. Rather than direct financial reparations to the descendants of enslaved people, the report recommends the fund be used to improve educational opportunities for descendants, establish relationships with Black colleges and universities, and honor enslaved people through memorials, curriculum, and research.</description>

Let’s see that executive order first, Joe.The new ‘Vette will join the growing list of notorious, engine-revving, sleeveless-shirt-wearing-macho-dude vehicles being electrified. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! GM President Mark Reuss said that Chevy will sell an “electrified” (AKA hybrid, probably) Corvette next year, and eventually make it all-electric. GM said last June it would invest $35 billion through 2025 to boost EV- and autonomous vehicle (AV) tech, including spending $7 billion to build a Michigan battery plant and update other factories in the state for EV production. Last August, President Biden even joked during a speech, “When they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it.” Last July, Dodge said it would release an EV muscle car in 2024. There’s been a lot of anticipation for the iconic sports car’s non-gas version since GM said in January 2021 it would commit to exclusively selling EVs by 2035. Zoom out: Legacy automakers are betting it all on an electric future. And Ford slapped the Mustang name on its first electric SUV in 2019.</description>

The BAYC Instagram account was hacked yesterday morning and a fake ad tricked users into clicking a link that gave hackers access to their digital wallets. The coach said the school violated his rights to religious expression; the school contends it couldn’t allow the prayers to continue, since they could be perceived as an endorsement of religion. The judge determined that Trump failed to hand over documents related to an investigation by New York’s attorney general, who is looking into whether Trump inflated asset values in his financial statements. The Supreme Court heard opening arguments yesterday in a case brought by a public high school football coach in Washington state, who was suspended from his job for leading prayers on the field after games. The former president will have to fork over $10,000 a day in fines after being held in contempt of court by a New York judge. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}Subscribe💰 Things could get expensive for Donald Trump.</description>

  <title>Donald Trump held in contempt of court for failing to produce documents</title>

The BAYC Instagram account was hacked yesterday morning and a fake ad tricked users into clicking a link that gave hackers access to their digital wallets. The coach said the school violated his rights to religious expression; the school contends it couldn’t allow the prayers to continue, since they could be perceived as an endorsement of religion. The judge determined that Trump failed to hand over documents related to an investigation by New York’s attorney general, who is looking into whether Trump inflated asset values in his financial statements. The Supreme Court heard opening arguments yesterday in a case brought by a public high school football coach in Washington state, who was suspended from his job for leading prayers on the field after games. The former president will have to fork over $10,000 a day in fines after being held in contempt of court by a New York judge. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}Subscribe💰 Things could get expensive for Donald Trump.</description>

  <title>GM officially announced an electrified Corvette</title>

Let’s see that executive order first, Joe.The new ‘Vette will join the growing list of notorious ,engine-revving, sleeveless-shirt-wearing-macho-dude vehicles being electrified. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! GM President Mark Reuss said that Chevy will sell an “electrified” (AKA hybrid, probably) Corvette next year, and eventually make it all-electric. GM said last June it would invest $35 billion through 2025 to boost EV- and autonomous vehicle (AV) tech, including spending $7 billion to build a Michigan battery plant and update other factories in the state for EV production. Last August, President Biden even joked during a speech, “When they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it.” Last July, Dodge said it would release an EV muscle car in 2024. There’s been a lot of anticipation for the iconic sports car’s non-gas version since GM said in January 2021 it would commit to exclusively selling EVs by 2035. Zoom out: Legacy automakers are betting it all on the electric game. And Ford slapped the Mustang name on its first electric SUV in 2019.</description>

A spokesperson for Esso, an Exxon subsidiary that placed the order, said the company had made the purchase before Russia launched its invasion and had no plans to buy more Russian oil. Greenpeace Norway leader Frode Pleym said the action was in protest of Norway buying Russian oil, “which we know finances Putin’s warfare.” What you’re looking at: Environmental activists chained themselves to a tanker that was offloading its cargo of 105,000+ tons of Russian oil in a Norway port.</description>

The protest song “Do You Hear The People Sing?” css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! css-y2oq5g[data-disabled]{opacity:0.5;cursor:not-allowed;box-shadow:var(--chakra-shadows-none);}. css-1dlcpt7[data-disabled]{opacity:0.4;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,. They’re the most senior-ranking US officials to visit the city since Russia’s invasion, though many top European leaders have already been to Kyiv to talk with Zelensky. Shanghai authorities were seen erecting green fences around residential areas in an apparent attempt to keep people in the locked-down city from leaving their homes. Apparently Musk’s ability to come up with $46.5 billion in financing changed leadership’s thinking from vehemently opposed to “OK, maybe we should negotiate.” Twitter is reevaluating Elon Musk’s bid to buy the company for $43 billion, the WSJ reported.</description>

  <title>NYC's salary transparency law faces pushback from businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/81f06e22894fc31f01a6ebb7a1445b6b022c14db-1024x683.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeNew York City’s monumental pay transparency law is set to take effect on May 15, meaning that nearly every company operating in the city will have to include a pay range for all open job listings. Critics of the amendment said these employees—including those in the food services and retail industries—are some of the city’s most marginalized workers who are most in need of pay transparency. During testimony over the amendment, some small-business advocates also claimed the law would allow larger companies to easily outbid them for talented hires. While the law is still set to go into effect on May 15, the amended bill is currently in committee. But a proposed amendment to the law—supported by large business groups and under consideration by the city council—could limit its scope, create room for loopholes, and delay its implementation until November. —MK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In a letter to the City Council, the Partnership for New York City (a powerful business group) criticized it for lacking input from the employers it would affect. But radical transparency has proven effective at addressing the wage gap and giving employees an idea of what their work is worth. In the original wording of the amendment, businesses with 15 or fewer employees would be exempt—a change that would have removed around 58,000 NYC companies and 500,000 employees from the scope of the law. That’s a big deal, as pay transparency laws exist largely to address racial and gender pay gaps.</description>
