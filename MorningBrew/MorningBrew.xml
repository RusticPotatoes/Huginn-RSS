  <title>NYC's salary transparency law faces pushback from businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/81f06e22894fc31f01a6ebb7a1445b6b022c14db-1024x683.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeNew York City‚Äôs monumental pay transparency law is set to take effect on May 15, meaning that nearly every company operating in the city will have to include a pay range for all open job listings. Critics of the amendment said these employees‚Äîincluding those in the food services and retail industries‚Äîare some of the city‚Äôs most marginalized workers who are most in need of pay transparency. During testimony over the amendment, some small-business advocates also claimed the law would allow larger companies to easily outbid them for talented hires. While the law is still set to go into effect on May 15, the amended bill is currently in committee. But a proposed amendment to the law‚Äîsupported by large business groups and under consideration by the city council‚Äîcould limit its scope, create room for loopholes, and delay its implementation until November. ‚ÄîMK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In a letter to the City Council, the Partnership for New York City (a powerful business group) criticized it for lacking input from the employers it would affect. But radical transparency has proven effective at addressing the wage gap and giving employees an idea of what their work is worth. In the original wording of the amendment, businesses with 15 or fewer employees would be exempt‚Äîa change that would have removed around 58,000 NYC companies and 500,000 employees from the scope of the law. That‚Äôs a big deal, as pay transparency laws exist largely to address racial and gender pay gaps.</description>

  <title>NYC's salary transparency law faces pushback from businesses</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeNew York City‚Äôs monumental pay transparency law is set to take effect on May 15, meaning that nearly every company operating in the city will have to include a pay range for all open job listings. Critics of the amendment said these employees‚Äîincluding those in the food services and retail industries‚Äîare some of the city‚Äôs most marginalized workers who are most in need of pay transparency. During testimony over the amendment, some small-business advocates also claimed the law would allow larger companies to easily outbid them for talented hires. While the law is still set to go into effect on May 15, the amended bill is currently in committee. But a proposed amendment to the law‚Äîsupported by large business groups and under consideration by the city council‚Äîcould limit its scope, create room for loopholes, and delay its implementation until November. ‚ÄîMK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In a letter to the City Council, the Partnership for New York City (a powerful business group) criticized it for lacking input from the employers it would affect. But radical transparency has proven effective at addressing the wage gap and giving employees an idea of what their work is worth. In the original wording of the amendment, businesses with 15 or fewer employees would be exempt‚Äîa change that would have removed around 58,000 NYC companies and 500,000 employees from the scope of the law. That‚Äôs a big deal, as pay transparency laws exist largely to address racial and gender pay gaps.</description>
