  <title>US Regulatory Panel Questions AstraZeneca Vaccine Results</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4476%2Fastrazeneca.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the wee hours of Tuesday morning, when nothing good ever happens, a panel that oversees US clinical trial safety said AstraZeneca's vaccine results may include "outdated and potentially misleading" data. Big picture: Vaccine hesitancy, in the US and abroad, started out higher than public health officials wanted. Add this to the growing listWhile AstraZeneca's vaccine has been authorized in 70+ countries, the rollout has faced Galaxy Note 7-level challenges. AstraZeneca's vaccine is less effective than Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines and (pending further data) potentially also Johnson &amp; Johnson's one-shot option.</description>

  <title>News Outlets Adjust to Life After Trump</title>

If you haven’t felt the itch to check Twitter 24/7, skim your preferred news site, or keep cable news humming in the background since President Trump left office, join the club. Politics consumption on major new sites dropped 28% from January to February, according to analytics company SimilarWeb, but interest in business and finance news only slightly declined over the same period.    The Washington Post is going the opposite route.</description>

Throw in the onset of a global pandemic, more efficient ways of receiving news (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn), and door-busting subscription deals, and conditions were ripe for news outlets to thrive.  TV: CNN lost almost half of its primetime viewership in the key 25–54 demographic in the period between President Biden's inauguration and March 15.</description>
