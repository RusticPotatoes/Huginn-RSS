Scott acknowledged wealth disparities in a Medium post announcing her donations yesterday, writing, "It would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands, and that the solutions are best designed and implemented by others." Yesterday, MacKenzie Scott announced she donated $2.7 billion to 286 organizations working to address issues including poverty, racial equity, and higher education.</description>

  <title>Lumber Prices Post Biggest Weekly Loss Ever</title>

For context: Since the early '90s, lumber futures have mostly traded between $200 and $600. Strong demand will probably keep lumber prices above pre-pandemic levels for at least 1–2 years, according to BMO analyst Mark Wilde.</description>

  <title>CEO and CFO of Electric Vehicle Maker Lordstown Motors Resign</title>

The Ford F-150 frunk might be as good as it’s going to get for electric trucks this year. Lordstown stock climbed more than 200% last summer.</description>

Nintendo could use tomorrow's announcement reel to finally unveil a new-and-improved Nintendo Switch.</description>

  <title>MLB Expected to Address Sticky Stuff Controversy in Coming Days</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1193%2Fbaseball_stadium.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitchers themselves aren't exactly pushing back. Well, the advantage pitchers gain from the sticky stuff may be contributing to one of the most pitiful batting displays in baseball's long history. Boosting offenses and maintaining what’s left of MLB’s integrity is critical to the long-term success of the league.</description>

How do I find my work-life balance at this company? You need to start setting expectations for yourself and for your coworkers that some parts of the day are off-limits for work matters. Comp questions can be really hard to navigate! The safest bet is to provide a salary range that would work for you.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: What If I Have Shares in a Non-Public Company?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4692%2Fbudget_scale.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It’s way easier to sell your shares if and when your company goes public or is acquired by another company. There are eBay-like marketplaces for selling private company shares, but it’s not like posting a picture of your old iPod and offering free shipping.  If you want to sell your stake before the company goes public, you can ask the execs at your company to buy back your shares.</description>

Mergers: A fourth bill would make it more difficult for Big Tech companies to snatch up smaller competitors. Conflict of interest: Huge tech companies wouldn't be able to own or operate a business that would incentive it to favor its own products over those of a competitor.  Those new lawsHere’s a quick look at the major themes of the five bills lawmakers dropped yesterday.</description>
