  <title>Democrats Announce $3.5 Trillion Budget Plan</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5265%2Fwhite_house_budget.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   It will address... The budget will require the backing of every Democrat in the 50-50 Senate, plus the tie breaking vote of VP Kamala Harris, to pass. Where will the money come from? The plan didn’t include lifting the debt ceiling, which would allow Uncle Sam to keep on borrowing to fund the spending.</description>

  <title>The new office politics? An ‘existential crisis’ for some</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6166%2Fpeople_talking_in_office_hallway.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lat speaks about a law firm that recently decreed employees must return to the office five days a week, only to be met with staff reaching out en masse to recruiters for jobs elsewhere. You may have heard of this described as the “hybrid” work environment, where some people work from home and others log on from a corporate office. The idea that office politics are winnable? “That might not be a bad thing because there are a lot of artificial deadlines of, ‘I want this on my desk first thing in the morning’ by bosses who, lo and behold, don’t read that until the afternoon or the next day,” he says.  The shift to a virtual workplace was hard on office politics, too, particularly in hidebound industries like finance and law where remote work was relatively rare before the pandemic. For example, some workers are easing their sense of urgency around work projects, Lat notes, because it proved to be a charade all along. What I’ve seen and heard from workers is that now, when a manager steps in, they’re actually getting in the way of work.” “The invisible work women have always done is finally being recognized and appreciated because men had to experience it,” says Dawn Bovasso, a freelance creative director in Boston who has written about workplace policies’ effects on women. “The old way was really exclusive, excluding a lot of people: people of color, women, the differently abled—a lot of people,” she says.  If the performative politics of pre-pandemic office life are a bowl of ice cream, the pandemic surely melted it. “This new way is going to be inclusive. If the corporate world’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic turned 2020 into a mad scramble for new protocols defined by adaptive office tools like Google Docs, Slack, and Zoom, then its adjustment to a tentative recovery suggests a partial return to the office and semi normalcy. “A lot of office politics is over stupid stuff and a lot of that stupid stuff is tied to the physical environment: fighting over the corner office, talking so loudly on calls that coworkers can hear them down the hall, being bad at bathroom etiquette, vaping at your desk, leaving smelly food in the break room,” he says. The virtual environment has undoubtedly given workers more power over their supervisors. “It is challenging to replicate office politics in a virtual era, which isn’t a bad thing,” says David Lat, a longtime analyst of law firm culture and himself a former top-tier recruiter. “So much of politics arises from physical interaction, so if we have less interaction we have less cause for conflict and less need for politics.” True, the completely virtual environment that many people have been working in for 17 months has hardly been a cakewalk.</description>

What institutional investors see in crypto While they remain skeptical about whether crypto has any practical use, institutional investors increasingly think digital assets have a place in an investment portfolio. Producing bitcoin requires a lot of energy Cryptocurrency, and bitcoin specifically, is criticized over the huge amount of energy used in bitcoin mining (environmental concerns is why Elon Musk decided to stop allowing bitcoin payments for Tesla several months ago.

Compare that to the more lax approach employed by countries like the US and the UK. Why it matters: Singapore is the most significant example yet of a country pivoting from a “Covid Zero” approach to a strategy that accepts Covid as “endemic,” meaning it’s always present but remains at a manageable level. “Living with Covid”Before its pivot, Singapore was part of a group of Asia-Pacific countries that played Whac-A-Mole to snuff out any trace of the coronavirus in an approach known as “Zero Covid.”</description>

  <title>Make It Work: I'm a Little Lost</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The first thing you should ask yourself is whether it’s a specific aspect of your current job that you dislike, or if it’s the line of work that you find unfulfilling. Most people who haven’t found a job that they are passionate about have stopped looking for one. Pick up a book on something you know nothing about (the Brew has a whole shelf full of recs). I don't like my current job but I have no idea what I would rather do instead. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds still don’t.”</description>

Fast fashion 2.0, known as “ultra-fast fashion” and popularized by brands like ASOS and Boohoo, got that process down to a week or two. Shein turns around a new design in as little as three days. As factory production gears up, Shein. If you’re not a Gen Z woman with a penchant for online shopping, you may have never heard of the world’s fastest-growing e-commerce company, Shein. If you are in that demographic, the brand likely follows you around the internet like an overly attached chihuahua. But moving this fast has resulted in Shein breaking things. An in-house design team then sends it to a Shein supplier located in China’s manufacturing hub, Guangzhou.</description>
