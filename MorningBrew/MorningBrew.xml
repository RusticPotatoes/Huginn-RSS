  <title>Biden Will Propose Nearly Doubling Capital Gains Tax</title>

Critics of the current capital gains system say, "So you're telling me this rich investor is paying less in taxes on their stock sales than a middle-class worker pays on their income? To pay for his second proposal, which includes spending on childcare and paid leave for workers, he wants to hike taxes on wealthy investors.</description>

  <title>NFTs, Intellectual Property, and What It Really Means to Own a Digital Kitty</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F4HkhMcckoSwdDBzho9%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluebox is a new NFT platform that automatically copyrights an artist’s song and then divides that into 100 NFTs that include 1% of the song’s copyright. Some platforms set terms for buyers’ intellectual property rights because the platforms themselves create and mint the NFTs. But on platforms like OpenSea and Nifty Gateway, where creators can mint NFTs of their own works…Artists aren’t so willing to give away their IP Giphy Surprise, surprise: There were no copyrights attached to the sales of multimillion-dollar music NFTs by 3LAU, Steve Aoki, Kings of Leon, and Grimes. And Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, who released a new song as an NFT in April, told Input magazine, “There’s nobody who’s serious about NFTs who really humors the idea that what you’re selling is the copyright or the master.”  An NFT without the copyright is like one of the purses, not Mickey Mouse himself.  For creators like Shinoda, that’s because selling the copyrights to his work would mean ceding all future profits that work could generate. An NFT can include IP, but it doesn’t have to.  Copyright permissions for NFTs can be set by the “minter” (the person who turns a creative asset into an NFT), or they can be set by “walled garden” platforms that do all the minting themselves. Whether the works of art represented by these blockchain-backed digital tokens are protected by copyright law. Picture this: NFTs and intellectual property (IP) are like the opposite sides of a Venn diagram. A copyright allows its owner to use a work in whichever way they choose, and to profit off of its use. The case gets more complicated than that, but it’s significant here because it's the first high-profile intellectual property squabble in the NFT space.</description>

  <title>Biden Administration Confronts Less Demand for Vaccines</title>

Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb estimates that only 150 million Americans (less than half the population) will get a vaccine.</description>

  <title>Netflix Announces Disappointing Streamer Growth in 2021</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4797%2Fnetflix_still_watching.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Netflix remains the majority of viewers’ No. 1 choice of stream-and-chill service, and up to 92% of viewers that signed up for competing streaming services also have Netflix. Netflix predicted that in Q2 only 1 million net new subscribers will join the service—that would make it the worst quarter for subscriber growth on record. Of course, last year was special: In prime position to benefit from pandemic lockdowns, Netflix managed to increase its subscriber base to 204 million and bump up the price on its standard streaming plan by $1 and its premium tier by $2. Looking ahead... 2.</description>

  <title>Pew: 91% of US Adults Now Support Legalized Marijuana in Some Form</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3946%2Fnug_rocket.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018, and Mexico could follow soon. Legalization can bring big economic opportunity: The US marijuana industry already supports 300,000+ full-time jobs—more than the number of dentists in the country. Bottom line: "Legalization will eventually win, and the vast majority of states, if not all, will soon join the ranks of the legalizers," Vox writes.  In their latest survey, Pew found that 60% of US adults now support legalized recreational and medical use and an additional 31% back medical marijuana. And a lack of federal standards has led to inconsistency around testing, labeling, and marketing.</description>
