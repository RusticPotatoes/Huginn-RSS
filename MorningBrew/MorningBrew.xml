  <title>Study Shows Automated Résumé Scanner Mistakenly Rejects Millions of Viable Job Candidates</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3645%2Fjob_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But some of those keywords might not seem obvious. While there are 10 million job openings in the US that employers desperately want to fill, the flawed automated hiring systems are excluding viable candidates.</description>

  <title>For the Defense Industry, 9/11 Changed Everything</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7294%2Fa_us_army_drone.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line: US military spending as a share of GDP has shrunk since peaking in 2011, but the booming homeland security industry it helped create remains a permanent fixture of the economy. Before September 11, 2001, the US had been cutting military spending. Military spending doubled to $700 billion in the decade following 9/11, to about 20% of total government spending.   Did you know?</description>

  <title>US Winds Down Massive, Controversial Unemployment Benefits Program</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F867%2Fusa.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backstory: In March 2020, as the US was shedding almost 1 million jobs per day, Congress authorized an extra $600/week in unemployment benefits on top of what states offered to keep jobless Americans afloat (the $600/week was later reduced to $300 in August 2020).  In all, the US government has spent $680 billion on unemployment benefits since last March, the second-highest amount among Covid stimulus programs behind only the Paycheck Protection Program ($835 billion). Around the same time, the government also expanded the number of workers eligible for unemployment insurance (UI) by including people like gig workers and the self-employed.</description>

  <title>Delta Crashes the Jobs Party</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l1J3MSRDWd2wTO0Wk/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47qbof7rmqjmhj0m5ogvjon1sfwz7mrbyimat56nc3&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This jobs report whiff will reverberate around DC.   US employers added just 235,000 jobs last month, compared to the 720,000 expected. Hiring was expected to fall from the 1.1 million jobs added in July and 962,000 in June, but nowhere near this much. In total, there are 5.6 million fewer workers holding jobs in the US now than before the pandemic hit.  Leisure and hospitality, a sector that falters when Covid anxieties are higher, reported no job increases last month.</description>

  <title>What Does it Mean if QR Codes Are Here to Stay?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7290%2Fqr_code.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, given that QR codes are likely not a pandemic fad and will be distracting us in restaurants for years to come, what are the implications? And half of all full-service restaurants in the US have opted for QR code menus since the beginning of the pandemic, per the National Restaurant Association. The ease of creating a QR code is one of the reasons why it’s so accessible for businesses, but it also increases opportunities for fraud. While it might seem like you’re just harmlessly ordering a Denny’s Grand Slam® after a long day, QR codes track when, where, and how often you scan them. Looks like it’s 2011 again: the cool kids are dressing like they’re in Gossip Girl, everyone’s talking about a Kanye album, and QR codes are trying to make it big. The Better Business Bureau even issued a warning this summer around fraudulent QR codes.</description>

In total, there are 5.6 million fewer workers holding jobs in the US now than before the pandemic hit. Hiring was expected to fall from the 1.1 million jobs added in July and 962,000 in June, but nowhere near this much. It was averaging 350,000 new jobs a month over the past six months. Looking ahead...</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with...Master Sommelier Ian Cauble</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7288%2Fian_cauble.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But most people don't have that bottle of wine you found on that shelf in that specific wine shop. With just a 5% pass rate, the top wine test has snarled the dreams of all but 267 people who are able to call themselves a true Master. In 2012, Ian Cauble passed the wine world’s version of astronaut training to become one of only a few Master Sommeliers in the world. Why is wine the go-to dinner party gift? Most people start by working in restaurants for a very long time—a lot of them for more than 10 years by the time they pass the Master Sommelier exam. It’s a very easy gift and there's usually a great story behind it. I would say most wine is not designed to age.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How to Get Honest Feedback?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The last thing you want is an employee who, in a final twist of irony, provides their only honest feedback during the exit interview.  Have a question about work you want to ask Shane? The number of managers who view feedback as a one-way street would make NYC’s grid blush. Do you have any advice for soliciting honest feedback? I had a manager who would ask during every 1-1 session if I had any feedback for them, a tactic I later found myself using with a few of my direct reports. The honest feedback comes to me and then I address it here on Sunday—what gives?  I’ve found the best strategy for collecting feedback from employees to be a diversified one. Write in here. Ask Shane here. Be one of the first subscribers to our upcoming newsletter on all things human resources.</description>

  <title>Nabisco Workers Strike Could Cause Supply Issues</title>

Grocery stores are stocking up on Nabisco treats because of a production slowdown at bakeries and distribution facilities around the country. Zoom out: Workers have been gaining leverage in a labor market where qualified employees are hard to find.</description>

Bottom line: Shang-Chi isn’t the only upcoming Marvel film having trouble getting past the bouncer in China.</description>

  <title>Floods, Fires Increase Urgency to Upgrade Infrastructure Preparedness in US</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7264%2Fremnants_of_hurricane_ida.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isn’t there an infrastructure bill in the works? – NF Hurricane Ida left 1 million Louisiana households and businesses without power earlier in the week, then on Wednesday dumped its leftovers on the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast. It contains $46 billion for building resilience against disasters, and advocates say the bill is crucial to beef up the US’ climate defenses.  Looking ahead... The new levees successfully fended off the worst of Ida on Sunday. Yep, a bipartisan plan passed the Senate this summer.   And we haven’t even mentioned the fires blazing out West, which are also exposing the weaknesses of California’s grid.</description>
