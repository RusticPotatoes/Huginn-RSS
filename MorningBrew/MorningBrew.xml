  <title>Apple Decides 2021 Isn’t a Year to Take Risks</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7409%2Fclark_kent_iphone_meme.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Big picture: Apple’s event comes just days after a judge forced the company to make the biggest change to the App Store since it was created in 2008. But besides a larger battery, a faster chip, and a smaller “notch” at the top of the screen, users won’t find that much difference between the new model and the iPhone 12.</description>

  <title>SpaceX’s All-Civilian Crew Prepares for Liftoff</title>

Zoom out: Through its Commercial Crew Program, NASA invested billions in both Boeing and SpaceX to get commercial space flight off the ground. Who’s joining him:Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and physician assistant at St. Jude, will become the youngest person ever to go to space at 29, and the first with a prosthetic body part.</description>

  <title>House Democrats Propose $2.9 Trillion in Tax Increases</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7399%2Ftax_hike.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tax proposal is seen as an olive branch to moderate Democrats who don’t want to play the villain to business. On the spicy scale, this plan is mildWhile it reverses many of the Republican tax cuts for 2018, the plan stops short of the ambitious tax hikes President Biden first proposed. Americans who earn more than $435,000 per year would see their top tax rate increase from 37% to 39.6%. House Democrats are all of us before wedding season as they scramble to cover the bill for their pricey $3.5 trillion budget proposal. – MM</description>

  <title>The Future Of Business Travel? The Experts at Morning Brew &amp; Hilton—And You—Weigh In</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7400%2Fbusiness_travel.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the Work Out of Work TravelThe infusion of biz travel with leisure activities—say it with us, bleisure—was popular pre-pandemic, but may become more of the norm as travelers make the most of these moments to work from virtually anywhere. * BTW: If you are not already a Hilton Honors member, it’s free to join, and new members can earn up to 5,000 Bonus Points through the end of the year. And there’s a very, very good chance it’ll have a lasting impact on what business travel looks like for years to come. With 48% of readers saying that loyalty program points and rewards were things they most looked forward to when traveling, it’s clear that perks will have even extra oomph as biz travel resumes.   Travel has its perks. New cardmembers can earn up to 180,000 Bonus Points*—equivalent to 4 FREE nights at more than 4,600 Hilton hotels worldwide—and get Hilton Honors Gold Status (hello complimentary room upgrades) AND earn Points at places like U.S. supermarkets, gas stations and restaurants. Turns out, Morning Brew readers miss business travel too. Paired with insights from Hilton’s Global Head of Marketing &amp; Loyalty Mark Weinstein, and our resident travel expert, Elyssa, we uncovered what you miss most about business travel (hello, alone time) —and what it could mean for the future. But the pandemic has pushed us to reconsider its purpose and pushed hotels like Hilton to reconsider their role in travelers’ lives, placing even more importance on meeting both their emotional and functional needs and desires, according to Weinstein. Hilton for example offered hotel rooms for guests to increase efficiency in their workday, and several hotels ran offers to allow business professionals to stay, work and play for an extended period of time. To appeal to new WFH travelers, hotels adapted by offering ideal working spaces and access to local coworking spots.

  <title>Epic Games Wins Lawsuit Against Apple</title>

The backstory: Last summer, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney martyred his top-earning game Fortnite by encouraging users to make in-game purchases (hamburger helmets, demogorgon skins) outside of Apple’s payment systems in protest of the steep commission Apple charges developers in its App Store.</description>

  <title>How is Covid Affecting Campus Life?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7309%2Fwoman_walks_on_a_college_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;58% of college students believe that their school should require vaccinations. Bella Mortel, a University of Texas at Austin Junior, said, “Seeing students and professors back on campus on the first day of school this year reminded me of how critical the in-person experience is! Only 28% of students had complete trust that their schools would keep them safe from Covid, while 47% of students said, “Yes, sort of.” Another ID to lose. Ben Klein, who started his third year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, “I feel more comfortable that we have to wear masks and social distance during in-person classes, but at the end of the day if our area gets swamped with Delta, Mu, or some other variant, I think cases are inescapable. In a Morning Brew + Generation Lab poll, we asked 524 college students across the US about their experiences back on campus. Students definitely, maybe trust their school.</description>
