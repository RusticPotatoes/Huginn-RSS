  <title>HYBE Acquires Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings for $1 Billion</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FibpyzXXfbiy1UkGRRO%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYBE acquired Ithaca Holdings for about $1 billion yesterday, but unless you own some turntables, you might want a refresher on who these two audio giants are:HYBE is a South Korean music company formerly named Big Hit Entertainment. It’s unclear exactly what that’ll look like, but if BTS’s rabid “Army” fan club backs it, it’ll be big.</description>

  <title>Robert Downey Jr. on His New Sustainability Venture: "I Never Learned Anything While I Was Talking."</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4615%2Frobert_downey_jr.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s a rut that’s so easy to get stuck in. For us [at Footprint], it’s not about being better or smarter. Are you in it because you got stuck and have a lot of shareholders and I’m the halo you’re missing? So I look at the character of the women and men of the team of that company. I’m just reading The Sympathizer. But it’s a starting point to get into the habit of seeing if our ideations on how to do things a little differently, and be part of that bridging between the consumer and the titans of industry and string-pulling politicians. You don’t get an education if you press a space bar, you know? I know that when it comes to the things that keep showing up, I’m real big on refusing the call. It’s just a different feeling. So for me, it was really about the people I met [in service of Footprint Coalition’s mission]. It’s about happening into a moment, a group, an inspiration that was going to hit anyway. You have a year like this, my brother, where our disgust response has gone up—where the powers that be say that something is really scary and you should go hide and we’ll tell you what to do next.   I very seldom know what’s going on. It’s the only spot I’ve ever really felt comfortable in my skin. I find myself in this odd position where I have some leverage; I can get anybody on the phone. I’m in a service industry and we work weekends. It’s like speed-dating at a high level, and sometimes at a low level. A little bit of an existential crisis always helps when you’re looking for a sea change. But my interest was always split between my call sheet and everything else in one bucket. I tend to balk at those firewalls—that doesn’t feel like me. There’s so much overdue inclusivity flooding into what felt like these imaginary bright lines that a smaller group of people had drawn. But it’s hard to turn an ocean liner on a dime. Now I’ve changed. Why turn the page entirely? I quickly realized you have to follow your gut and get cool, smart, influencers around you and see how you can be part of the solution. I’m just playing catch up. It’s crazy because you gotta show up for this. For me, interest over time promotes excellence. I have to thank all the people who are thought-leading this crisis correctly and putting me in a position where I have very little option but to engage. I don’t think [individuals] are that smart. “Is this [sustainability startup] one of those bro games?” Those people are doing that [work]. I always like that. There is not even a Spock-chess version of a capital E-easy beginner answer. What’s your anticipated return on investment? I think there are a lot of people who think they’re the smartest person they’ve ever met. There are four billion soccer kids and one ball.</description>

  <title>What Everyone's Arguing About: $$$ for College Athletes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4616%2Fcollege_basketball.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The backstoryFor more than a century, the NCAA has governed one of the most cherished traditions in America: college sports. There are now college sports video games.  If that makes you go 🤔, then you'd probably be interested in the crucial Supreme Court case over college athlete compensation that kicked off last Wednesday. Nick Saban, the Alabama football coach, will make $9.5 million this year.   They are: Fans enjoy the product specifically because the athletes are amateurs, not paid professionals.  The other sideThe NCAA uses a few different arguments to defend its amateurism model. Athletes are paid in the form of a free college education that might cost others more than $60k a year.</description>

  <title>Kate Noel, Head of People Ops at Morning Brew, Shares Advice with Readers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4613%2Fkate_s_column.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the happy medium that shows you take this interview seriously but also that you are cool enough to hire and be part of all the virtual company events to come. Can I wait until the morning to email her back?  My manager has a tendency to email me at 7–8pm, but I've been trying to keep a healthy work-life balance, which means closing my work laptop at 5:30pm.</description>

  <title>Biden Releases $2.3 Trillion Infrastructure Plan to Boost US Competitiveness and Combat Climate Change</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F781%2F1_train_in_nyc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biden will introduce Part 2 of his economic spending proposal in the next few weeks, called the American Family Plan. To help pay for it, Biden wants to bump up the corporate tax from 21% to 28% and close other tax loopholes. For the climate, the plan “would be the most far-reaching federal investment to date in programs that would help curb greenhouse gas emissions,” writes Axios. $400 billion to caregiving efforts for the elderly and those with disabilities.  $650 billion to improve your life at home, like investments in high-speed broadband and the electric grid.</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Writers Pick the Top Business News Story of Q1</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4567%2Fgamestop_stock_falls_more.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To me, that's what made GameStop mania the biggest story of the quarter—the broader financial world was forced to acknowledge the power of social media users to move markets. It feels like we're in the early stages of so many emerging crypto applications and I'm excited for what's to come.   I'm hopeful that, as the rollout continues, businesses will be able to operate at full throttle and we can tentatively start seeing what this hyped New Normal thing is all about. The US has done a really good job—as of Tuesday, about 15% of Americans are fully vaccinated and we're on pace to administer 200 million shots in Biden's first 100 days.</description>

  <title>Reader Q&amp;A: What Is Financial Leverage?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F14rfBl2RMAHtCM%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to borrow money to make purchases that, over time, can make you far more money than your initial capital could.  In the financial world, investors use the term "leverage" to refer to debt that's used to fund transactions. But while leverage can increase your reward, it can also increase risk, which is where the story of this hedge fund, Archegos Capital Management, comes in.  </description>

  <title>Amazon Unionization Vote: Here's What to Watch</title>

Union organizers may bring up Amazon's anti-union messaging campaign at the warehouse, which even followed workers into the bathroom. Plus, workers already get healthcare, vision, and dental benefits without paying union dues.</description>

  <title>Cameo Becomes A Unicorn</title>

Platforms like Cameo and Substack were already getting more popular as fans sought out a more direct connection with creators, but the pandemic made backstage content = all content.  Also in 2020, the similar-but-significantly-more-NSFW platform OnlyFans made $300 million in profit on $400 million in revenue, per The Information.</description>
