  <title>Nasdaq Turns Negative, 10-Year Rises as Fed Sticks to Status Quo</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2230%2Fjerome_powell.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an interview with the WSJ, Powell said that while he expects some inflation ahead, he doesn't think it'll last and the Fed will keep interest rates near zero. Inflation worries have sent bond yields—still low by historic standards—spiking, making investors worry that the Fed will raise interest rates to put a brake on the economy and keep inflation in check.   That sounded reassuring, but investors are still feeling nervous about inflation and the Fed potentally hiking rates. Yesterday, they turned to Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a reassuring hug.</description>

Inflation worries have sent bond yields—still low by historic standards—spiking upwards, making investors worry that the Fed will raise interest rates to put a brake on the economy and keep inflation in check.   That sounded reassuring, but investors are still feeling nervous about inflation and the Fed potentally hiking rates: They continued to drop stocks and bonds, sending yields higher.

  <title>Google Commits to Phasing Out Invasive Third-Party Cookies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4244%2Fgoogle_cookie_jar.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That way, businesses can still serve targeted ads, but your specific user data is a little more private since Google is essentially hiding it in a crowd. To a certain extent, the modern advertising businesses of internet giants like Google and Facebook are built on the buttery backs of cookies. Currently, using cookies, Google can see that a user was shopping for a new golf bag on Amazon, then later serve them a Callaway ad next to a Golf.  Now, through a program called “Privacy Sandbox,” Google is testing a way for companies to target ads to groups of users with similar interests instead of directly to individuals.</description>

Now that the wage increase is out, a handful of moderate Democrats who were skeptical of it are more likely to support the bill.

  <title>Buy-Now-Pay-Later Giant Klarna Worth $31B After Latest Round of Funding</title>

Companies like Macy's and Neiman Marcus still rely heavily on store- and co-branded credit card fees to pad their bottom lines, offerings that compete with BNPL options.  One of the earliest companies to the BNPL game, Klarna offers consumers the option to pay for an item online in installments rather than all at once.  But BNPL has put retail giants in a pickle.  That concerns regulators, since more than than 10% of customers at one bank that had used BNPL were already behind on their payments, according to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.</description>
