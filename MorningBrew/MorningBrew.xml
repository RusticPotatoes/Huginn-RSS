  <title>Mark Zuckerberg Wants Facebook to Become a Metaverse Company. But What Does He Mean By That?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F374%2Fepic_games_fortnite.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; “In the coming years, I expect people will transition from seeing us primarily as a social media company to seeing us as a metaverse company,” he said on Facebook’s earnings call Wednesday.  The backstory: The term “metaverse” first showed up in Neal Stephenson’s sci-fi novel Snow Crash in 1992, and was built upon by other science fiction thinkers like Ernest Cline, who depicted a version of the metaverse in his book Ready Player One.

  <title>Scarlett Johansson Sues Disney for ‘Black Widow’ Streaming Release</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5966%2Fblack_widow.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But Black Widow made a lot of money outside of theaters—$60 million from Disney+. Big picture: Companies like Disney have thrown tens of billions into the streaming wars. Black Widow earned $80 million at its opening weekend at the box office, a record for pandemic times, but not great for a Marvel movie.</description>

  <title>US Economy Surges to Pre-Pandemic Levels, but Comes in Lower Than Forecasts</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/27bPvfGBYcaxqMSyCZ/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   What’s not working Supply chain snags: Apple and Tesla this week joined the chorus of companies warning that the chip shortage was hurting their businesses. But in general, he thinks with high vaccination rates the “effects will probably be less.  If that’s the parade, here’s a little rain: The 6.5% annual growth rate last quarter fell below forecasts, showing there are still some mustard stains on the economy’s T-shirt.</description>

  <title>The Delta Variant Puts The Breaks on Return to Office</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/H6W9H29kVsUI2hJE90/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its announcement yesterday, Google said that anyone coming into the office would need to be vaccinated.  Google's one of a number of companies rethinking their workplace plans due to the—okay fine we’ll go there—fourth wave of Covid-19. Google employees hung up their business hoodies and put on their home hoodies after CEO Sundar Pichai postponed the company’s return to the office by a month-and-a-half, to mid-October. The Ultas, Sweetgreens, and transit systems of the world are counting on you to spend money during the workday like you did in 2019.</description>
