  <title>Reader Q&amp;A: What Is Financial Leverage?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F14rfBl2RMAHtCM%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to borrow money to make purchases that, over time, can make you far more money than your initial capital could.  In the financial world, investors use the term "leverage" to refer to debt that's used to fund transactions. But while leverage can increase your reward, it can also increase risk, which is where the story of this hedge fund, Archegos Capital Management, comes in.  </description>

  <title>Amazon Unionization Vote: Here's What to Watch</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F825%2Famazon.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  There's a close race to follow in Bessemer, AL, that decides whether or not 6,000 Amazon warehouse workers unionize. Union organizers may bring up Amazon's anti-union messaging campaign at the warehouse, which even followed workers into the bathroom. Plus, workers already get healthcare, vision, and dental benefits without paying union dues.</description>

State media outlets called out other apparel brands, including Nike and Adidas, that've made statements about boycotting Xinjiang cotton. And celebrities including Wang Yibo and Victoria Song are dropping H&amp;M and/or Nike endorsements.   On Tuesday, a human rights group coalition sent a letter to Airbnb asking it to pull out, questioning the company's commitment to "social responsibility."</description>

Sunday Edition will be available for everyone, which allows us to devote more resources to this newsletter and provide readers with top-tier content. But in the meantime, I want to share the basic structure of the new newsletter, give Light Roast a proper send-off, and explain why we decided to make the change.  Light Roast provided a fantastic space for us writers to connect with Brew readers on a more personal level, one that we will certainly miss. We are replacing Light Roast with a new reward.</description>

  <title>Germany Avoids “Baby Bust” With Rising Birth Rates</title>

No one’s totally sure, but some economists are pointing to Kurzarbeit, Germany’s state-funded safety net.</description>

  <title>Ever Given, the Ship Stuck in the Suez Canal, Has Been Partially Refloated</title>

You can get deep about it.  The Ever Given, a mind-bogglingly huge container ship that’s been blocking the Suez Canal for almost a week, holding up an estimated $9.6 billion in goods a day, is way less stuck than it used to be.   But that hasn’t stopped everyone from having a little fun at the ship’s expense—okay, a lot of fun. The moon.</description>

Basically, what allegedly happened is that Archegos's lenders forced it to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares on Friday. In Saturday’s Brew, we noted that shares in Discovery and ViacomCBS had plunged on Friday following analyst downgrades.</description>

  <title>Why Morning Brew Added Bitcoin to the Markets Section</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F938%2Fbitcoin_bull.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We think our Markets section will be more relevant to readers with bitcoin in it. It's simply a recognition that finance, just like anything else, is changing, and our newsletter should reflect that. Perhaps you just took a tequila shot out of happiness. In their place, we added 1) bitcoin and 2) a "flex" spot, which will allow us to showcase any security—whether it's a tech stock, oil, or dogecoin—that made an interesting move the previous day.</description>

  <title>NFTs: Frequently Asked Questions</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FVypJYbpuh7ZtK%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And yes, you can make money off of an NFT by buying and reselling it for more.  An NFT is “a type of cryptographic token,” Emerging Tech Brew writer Ryan Duffy explains, but NFTs are different from cryptocurrencies because they’re not interchangeable.   When a digital asset goes on sale, you’re randomly chosen to buy it. Can I make money on it? One reason to buy an NFT is for its emotional value, which isn’t so different from physical objects... They buy it for the way it makes them feel. The same can be true for a GIF, image, video, or other digital asset.  On Top Shot for instance, you register to join a waitlist that can be thousands of NBA fans long. Defining the blockchain is a whole ‘nother can of worms that you can read about here.  How do you buy an NFT?</description>

Basically, what allegedly happened is that Archegos's lenders forced it to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares on Friday.

You can get deep about it.  The Ever Given, a mind-bogglingly huge container ship that’s been blocking the Suez Canal for almost a week, holding up an estimated $9.6 billion in goods a day, is way less stuck than it used to be.   But that hasn’t stopped everyone from having a little fun at the ship’s expense—okay, a lot of fun.

  <title>Germany Avoids “Baby Bust” With Rising Birth Rates</title>
