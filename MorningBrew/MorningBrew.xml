  <title>Apple’s self-repair program disappoints right-to-repair advocates</title>

The backstory: Last month, Apple launched its Self Service Repair Store, which allows customers to buy parts for select Apple devices they can repair at home. Apple said in a white paper last month, “For the vast majority of customers, the safest and most reliable repair is achieved through an Apple Store. —JW css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Bottom line: Critics say Apple doesn’t want customers to repair their phones at home, and, when this program proves to be unpopular, will use it as evidence against right-to-repair initiatives.</description>

  <title>Hey, Miso Robot—can I get fries with that?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/e353f9d9fcd860e440ec66f597542d4f533911da-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s what the future of quick-service restaurants (QSR) could look like with Miso Robotics. When it’s combined, you see a robot doing the work of roughly two people during peak periods in a quiet, seamless, and very efficient way. We're not just going to wake up one day, and there’ll be 1.5 million new workers happily jumping into the restaurant industry. We really see ourselves as a solution to the labor crisis in the quick serve restaurant industry. from our sponsorFired up about Flippy and its robot siblings? When someone sees Flippy taking frozen fries all the way through to the cook station and serving cooked fries, you can kinda just drop the mic. What do you see Miso’s role in the restaurant industry? And the automation guy is saying, “I think that the technology has now evolved in such a way that it’s approachable and affordable today for a robot to take over some of the tasks.” What Flippy does is simple: It takes frozen fries all the way through the fry process and dispenses cooked fries. Yeah, so if you look at fast-food restaurants, fries go with almost every order. Miso is still open to investors as they take on the $300B US Quick Serve Restaurant Industry. I was talking to some of the workers who have had one of our Flippy units installed for the longest period of time. Our mission is to automate restaurants, and we’re starting with automating fry stations. Where did the idea for the Flippy come from?</description>

  <title>40% of recent job switchers are looking for a new job again</title>

That being said, job switching continues to be one of the best ways to boost your stats on celebritynetworth. New research into the American job market shows that many people who recently quit their job for another one are pretty quickly itching to quit the new job, too. LinkedIn data backs that up: The company found that the share of job switchers who’d been at their previous job for less than 12 months rose by 6.5% in 2021 compared to 2020. —MK And, per the Grant Thornton survey, 40% of workers who took a new job reported a pay increase of at least 10%, more than double all other survey respondents. But 40% of that group is actively looking for another job, compared to 29% of all full-time employees—revealing some significant buyer’s remorse among job jumpers.</description>

Yesterday’s shooting in Texas was the 27th school shooting this year, which means one has occurred roughly every five days in 2022. It was also just one of several mass shootings across the country in the past couple weeks. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas called the shooting “truly horrific,” but rejected Dems’ calls for gun reform and instead proposed stepped-up security at schools. Laguna Woods, CA: A day after the Buffalo shooting, a man was killed and four others wounded at a shooting at a Taiwanese church.</description>

At the same time, they’re fleeing the euro because Europe is more vulnerable to a severe economic downturn than the US. The euro closed Friday at about $1.057 against the dollar, just 5% above equal value with the US currency. Of course, the consequences of a stronger dollar go beyond cheaper European delights. Bottom line: This isn’t just a dollar &gt; euro story; it’s a dollar &gt; everyone story. Why is this happening?

  <title>Spain could become the first European country to offer menstrual leave</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. One curveball with a paid period leave policy: people who menstruate may not use it. But none offer a policy quite as robust as Spain’s. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeSpain’s government approved a draft bill this week that would create a nationwide menstrual leave policy for workers—meaning that if a woman gets a doctor’s note for severe period pain, they would be eligible to take government-funded PTO. In Japan, where paid period leave has been around the longest, dating back to 1947, the policy has seen a steep decline in use. Between 50%–90% of women experience pain during periods, and 33% responded that the pain prevents them from performing daily activities. As it stands, menstrual leave is about as common as a tampon commercial without women dancing in white pants.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Every recession since 1968 has prompted a bear market like the one we’re currently in, per CFRA Research. In fact, a big stock market sell-off is exactly what the Fed wants to see in order to slow economic activity, and in turn, bring inflation back to normal. The Dow posted its eighth straight weekly loss, which is its longest weekly losing streak since 1923. And this week, any optimism was dashed when ol’ reliables Target and Walmart posted lousy results, sending their stocks tumbling the most since the market crash of 1987.</description>

  <title>Spain could become the first European country to offer menstrual leave</title>

But none offer a policy quite as robust as Spain’s. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeSpain’s government approved a draft bill this week that would create a nationwide menstrual leave policy for workers—meaning that if a woman gets a doctor’s note for severe period pain, they would be eligible to take government-funded PTO. In Japan, where paid period leave has been around the longest, dating back to 1947, the policy has seen a steep decline in use. As it stands, menstrual leave is about as common as a tampon commercial without women dancing in white pants.</description>
