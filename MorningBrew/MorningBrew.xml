  <title>How the Fed actually hikes interest rates</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. When a bank has excess cash on hand, it can loan it out to another one that needs it. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeOn Wednesday, the Fed is expected to hike interest rates even higher to bring inflation back from levels we haven’t seen in decades. Instead, the central bank adjusts what’s known as the “federal funds rate,” which is the average interest rate that banks pay each other for overnight loans. This week, we’re going to carve out some space to explore interest rate hikes from a variety of angles. The banks lending to each other typically settle on an interest rate near the midpoint of the Fed’s range. Because Fed Chair Jerome Powell doesn’t just show up at your bank and tell them to raise their interest rates. Like, what are the mechanics? What that is: Commercial banks borrow and lend money to each other so that they can meet liquidity requirements set by regulators before the business day begins. You should also know that the Fed picks a range for the federal funds rate—not a specific number. In March, when the Fed hiked interest rates for the first time following the onset of the pandemic, it raised its target range from 0–25 basis points to 25–50.</description>

It’s unlikely that Buffett has ever touched an Xbox controller, but Berkshire Hathaway is now the largest shareholder of Activision Blizzard after amassing a 9.5% stake. Around the topic of the stock market, Buffett said the influx of new traders buying and selling stocks during the pandemic has turned the market into “almost totally a casino” in which large American companies have become “poker chips.” Buffett said that inflation “swindles almost everybody” and was a result of the Fed’s gargantuan stimulus measures to prop up the economy during the pandemic. Of course, Buffett would never call it “buying the dip” because he doesn’t believe in timing the market. And…video games? So what did he buy? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>

  <title>Why are dolphins guarding a Russian naval base?</title>

The US jump-started its marine mammal military program in 1960, primarily employing bottlenose dolphins and sea lions to accomplish a variety of underwater tasks humans just don’t have the fins for. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeWe know a decent amount about the US’ use of marine mammals for military purposes after information was leaked about the program in 1992. Their most likely porpoise—sorry, purpose—is to defend Russian warships against enemy divers, serving as a crucial line of defense for what is Russia’s most important naval base on the Black Sea.While we can see you there looking shocked at the existence of a Russian dolphin infantry division…Marine mammals have a long history of military serviceAnd not just for the Russians. Dolphins’ skills were on display during the Iraq War in 2003. Big picture: Over time, humans have become a lot more skilled at leveraging marine mammals to win wars.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. A key question I have is whether your boss is aware of your side hustle. I dog-sit as a side hustle, so I happily obliged when he asked if I was free. The first of the month is traditionally a big day for bones: Some of us owe them, others collect them, and a hip-hop group that bears the name gave us an iconic 90s track to help mark the calendar. What should I do? Anything nagging at you? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! My boss has a new puppy and needed someone to watch her for the weekend. Is it possible your boss was simply biding his time so that he could wake up and settle his debts with the rest of us today? Share your workplace conundrum with Make It Work here. Probably not, so let’s work out your best move here. I feel awkward asking, especially since he’s my boss, but I deserve to be paid for the work I did. Ask Shane here. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeEach week, our workplace whisperer Shane Loughnane answers a reader-submitted question about problems at work.</description>

So that’s when it’s a problem: when we say we’re going to do one thing and yet we’re doing something else. What I want to cater to is the person who’s like me: I would be the kind of person who said I’d do one thing and I do something else.

  <title>Johnny Depp, Amber Heard’s defamation trial is a social media circus</title>

TikToks tagged with the hashtag #justiceforjohnnydepp are nearing 6 billion views, and one viral video shows an LA Starbucks with a full tip jar that reads “Johnny Depp” and an empty one with “Amber Heard” on it. Even brands are chiming in: Milani Cosmetics made a TikTok contradicting Heard’s attorney’s claim that Heard used a specific makeup kit to cover up bruises from domestic violence, saying the kit referenced wasn’t available yet. —MM css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeIt never takes too long for a celebrity trial to go completely off the rails, but in just two-and-a-half weeks, the Johnny Depp–Amber Heard libel trial has overrun TikTok. Depp supporters have flocked to social media and YouTube livestreams of the trial to share their extremely anti-Amber Heard views.</description>

  <title>Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network suffers largest-ever crypto hack</title>

The details: The hack drained roughly $617 million worth of ether and USDC from the Ronin Network—a “layer 2” solution (layer 1 being the Ethereum blockchain) that conducts crypto transactions for Axie Infinity. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. One of blockchain technology’s big promises is enhanced security, but so far its track record is muddier than a Dirty Jobs episode. —JW But there’s a trade-off: Ronin is less secure than the blockchain it supports. According to a post from Ronin yesterday, most of the stolen funds are still sitting in that wallet, and Ronin is working 25/7 with regulators to get them back. In this case, hacker(s) took control of enough of the “nodes” that greenlight transactions on Ronin to funnel money into their own ethereum wallet. Because Ronin is off-chain, its transactions are faster, cheaper, and less energy intensive than on-chain ones.</description>

  <title>So, you want to take your paycheck in bitcoin?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/staging/87048d816e4666cccd98872c2ec2377cf9b887ec-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On payday, the crypto software company, which requires all the employees to be paid in bitcoin, exchanges an employee’s wage from US dollars to bitcoin and sends it to the employee’s crypto wallet. But the digital infrastructure still needs to catch up so Adams can use his crypto to pay for the subway or Suarez can pay for cafecito. But Richardson and Adams aren’t living paycheck to paycheck: They operate on the higher end of the risk spectrum and don’t need to liquidate their crypto checks immediately to buy groceries or pay rent. If an employee is paid right after a market pullback and the crypto loses a substantial portion of value, a disgruntled employee could argue the employer violated minimum wage laws. Despite all the headlines about celebrities taking their pay in cryptocurrencies, there isn’t much one can do with the crypto check. Richardson said his loss “sucks” but added, “I can afford to do that.” Adams also lost money during the crypto market crash. Until that happens, a bitcoin paycheck isn’t the most practical option. To get technical, Adams, Suarez, and Richardson aren’t actually being paid in bitcoin or ethereum. Exodus employee Allysa Howell chooses to convert 90% of her bitcoin paycheck to dollars within 24 hours of payday. Adams had to get creative and convert his salary into bitcoin and ethereum by using Coinbase. So he didn’t cash any of his crypto paycheck. With such big names backing bitcoin paychecks, they’re officially a trend. Upstream currently doesn’t pay employees in crypto. Exodus provides a 3–5% buffer to account for volatility of bitcoin price and exchange fees, but it’s common for bitcoin to increase or decrease in price by 5% or even 10% on any given day. Getting paid in bitcoin isn’t for everyone. Fisher Phillips’s Bauknight warns that paying employees in bitcoin is a gray area. Unlike Exodus, the New York City government doesn’t own any bitcoins and it isn’t allowed to pay workers in cryptocurrency.</description>
