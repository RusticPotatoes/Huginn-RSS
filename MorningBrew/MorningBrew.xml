  <title>Q3 2020 Recap</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Jl4M6CA3Id6Op5SXRD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional golf has been underway for months with only minor testing headaches, while the pandemic-era versions of the Tour de France, the U.S. Open in tennis, and the Kentucky Derby went off smoothly. If the first two quarters of the year meant us coming to terms with a global pandemic, Q3 saw us settling into a ~new normal~ of face masks, parking lot dining, and saying "whoops, sorry!"   So what about K-12?   Q3 was the busiest for public offerings since the dot-com era.   That was a lot.   The election, for one.   Over the last three months, extreme weather events made more intense and frequent by human-induced climate change have ravaged communities across the country. There's actually good news.   Pulse check on the economic recovery  It's...   So why are biz leaders wearing out DocuSign?   Looking ahead On the monetary side...   On the corporate side...   On the fiscal side...   Looking ahead... School Reopenings Test Students, College Towns, and Parents After schools across the country closed their doors in the spring, John Krasinski hosted virtual prom, graduation ceremonies were streamed online, and at least one student accidentally said, “Sup, b****?”   Soccer: A  This summer, the National Women's Soccer League became the first major U.S. sports league to return to action from the Covid break, while the MLS has already welcomed fans back in certain states.    How the Economic Recovery Fared in Q3 As the ink dries on Q3, nearly 900,000 Americans are filing new jobless claims each week.   The Atlantic Coast produced so many big tropical storms that the World Meteorological Organization depleted its list of 21 names by September and is now using the Greek alphabet. Even where students can attend school, many parents have chosen not to enroll them. University of Iowa students angered Twitter (an easy feat, really) by lining up for downtown bars in Iowa City, which earlier this month had the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases per capita in the U.S. But for local businesses like The Airliner bar, students returning to campus is their only lifeline—revenue was $0 in April.   Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Parts of the West Coast have been ablaze since August, with a record 3.7 million acres burned across California. Climate change is no longer one of those problems. the M&amp;A could keep flowing, but experts think the IPO frenzy will settle by late October.   Whether you want to relive summer 2020 or would rather pretend it never happened, we present: the Brew's third quarter recap. Basketball: A+  Zero NBA players have tested positive for Covid-19 since entering the famous "bubble" in Orlando. The Tampa Bay Rays, the Brew’s July pick to win it all, entered the postseason as the top team in the American League. But with the election and a Supreme Court fight ahead, don't hold your breath for more emergency aid until the Christmas lights come out.</description>

  <title>Uber Sells Self-Driving Division to Aurora Innovations</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3350/aurora.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Uber is reportedly unloading its air taxi division too.   Why Uber is letting go:  Self-driving cars are expensive.   Who is Aurora? Uber hasn’t completely given up on AVs—it’ll eventually use Aurora's self-driving cars.   Big picture: Several self-driving startups have downsized or closed shop during the pandemic.

  <title>California Water Futures are First to Trade on Chicago Mercantile Exchange</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3349/water_futures.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  If you buy a futures contract, you agree to purchase the asset at a predetermined price on a future date.   California farmers could use the help California is the country's largest water market by a magnitude of four, but the quality of its water supply is less consistent than a container of strawberries in January. Investors can buy futures contracts for everything from fresh bacon to Burgundy wine, but the commoditization of an element critical to daily life is worrying to some observers—especially as water access becomes more strained."</description>

  <title>Ikea to Stop Making Iconic Catalog After this Year</title>

  <title>Disappointing Jobs Report May Increase Chances of Stimulus Deal</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3320/jobless_rate.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The restaurant industry lost jobs for the first time since April.   9.8 million fewer Americans remain employed than before the pandemic.   Looking ahead... So, like any astute economic observers, we expected stocks to fall and Treasury prices to rise (Treasuries are considered a safe haven for investors when the economic outlook goes south). The U.S. economy added 245,000 jobs last month, a reading below expectations and less than half of the 610,000 job gains in October. The weekend is shaping up to be an eventful one in D.C.</description>

  <title>The McRib’s Many Economic Conspiracy Theories</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3268/mcrib.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies choose to take an L on these items in the hopes that it will lure customers to buy profitable products that recoup the loss.   While there’s no direct link between McRib rollouts and the Mayan calendar, there are a few popular conspiracy theories detailed by Willy Staley in The Awl purporting to explain why the McRib occasionally rises from the fast food ashes... Theory #1: Porky arbitrage   Axios Does McDonald’s time McRib releases to the pork price cycle for a bigger profit per sandwich?   If McRibs were as popular as McNuggets, it’s feasible they’d also become a forever menu item and the pork industry would play catch-up like chicken had. Eventually, the chicken supply caught up to McDonald’s demand, while the McRib’s popularity waned. + This theory could tie back to the first one: If the McRib is indeed a loss leader, McDonald’s would have more reason to take advantage of low pork prices.</description>

  <title>Special Report: How Vaccines Are Made</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/dUUw7Z1Jps4xLWZOWX/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Getting in Line for a Vaccine Like   Giphy Reality check: There won't be enough Covid-19 vaccines for everyone for a while. $21—the difference in price between Moderna's vaccine ($25/dose) and AstraZeneca's vaccine ($4/dose), according to U.S. purchase agreements.   Vaccine candidates 67 vaccine candidates are currently in various stages of clinical trials around the world.   10 billion single doses could be available by the end of 2022 if all the frontrunner vaccine candidates are approved.   But not so fast: Moderna's vaccine requires two doses 28 days apart.   Once We Have a Vaccine...   Let's Hit the Road  We just spit a lot of information at you about the vaccine supply chain. #3: Not everyone will get a vaccine.   Let’s set the mood with this passage from The Economist:  “Deliverance, when it arrives, will come in a small glass vial.   Who next?   The early leaders? How the Magic Happens   Francis Scialabba Maybe Thanksgiving is getting us sentimental, but the concept of a vaccine is kind of...   The next round of Phase 1 will include other vulnerable groups such as...   Vaccine manufacturing is Isla de Muerta  It's an island that cannot be found, except by those who already know where it is.   Pharma Companies Channel Their Inner Elsa   Giphy Leading vaccine candidates are more temperature-sensitive than your dad who doesn't let anyone touch the thermostat. But can employers legally require their workers to get vaccines? The Duke Global Health Institute estimates 9.6 billion doses are already reserved by individual countries, without any vaccines having reached the market yet.   Zoom out: The companies currently vying to get a Covid-19 vaccine to market are pursuing different biological methods, in the hopes that a "throw everything against the wall" approach will lead to a few sticking.       Economist That's a bit lopsided Which is where Covax comes in. Distribution 8,000 fully filled 747 cargo planes would be needed to distribute a single vaccine dose to the world's 7.8 billion people, per the International Air Transportation Association. The total costs of vaccine development can run up to $500 million, one study found. We'll walk through everything from how a vaccine is made to who gets the first shot to whether your boss can force you to get one.   Storage is tight. Establishing public trust in these vaccines will be the next major challenge for health officials. Where do vaccines come from?   Short answer: Yes.*  *There are exceptions for people with disabilities or those with "sincerely held" religious beliefs against vaccination.   Big picture: The Duke Global Health Institute thinks it'll take until 2024 for vaccines to reach the entire population. Probably not, but Pfizer does.   Did you know there's currently a shortage of sand needed to make glass vials for vaccine storage?   Plus, it's not cheap. With an $18+ billion budget ($12+ million of which has already been doled out), the goal is to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective vaccine by Jan. 2021.   Then, they're on the road, this time to a regional distribution center.   Methodologies vary, but the overall breakdown goes something like this:  Step 1: Create an antigen (a substance that provokes your immune system).   Dry ice is the cold chain's best friend.   How it works: There are 184 countries participating, with wealthier countries subsidizing vaccine access for 92 lower- and middle-income ones, particularly across Africa and South and Southeast Asia. In a November Gallup poll, 42% of U.S. adults said they would not get an FDA-approved coronavirus vaccine. The vaccine will head to an administration site like a mobile clinic or a Costco, where injectees will get a shot, a chicken bake, six gallons of salsa, and be on their way.</description>
