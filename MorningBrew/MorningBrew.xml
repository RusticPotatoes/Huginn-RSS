Buffett said SPACs have made it even harder for Berkshire to strike a deal at an attractive price.  Robinhood: Buffett said Robinhood’s platform for retail investors was “taking advantage of the gambling instincts of society, and it isn’t admirable.</description>

Does Apple have an illegal monopoly over app distribution?</description>

  <title>Apple’s AirTags Go On Sale</title>

Yesterday, the EU issued antitrust charges against Apple over its App Store practices. And Apple finds your dog differently than Tile does... While Tile finds devices using Bluetooth signals, each AirTag is equipped with an ultra-wideband chip that allows owners to track them down with much more precision than Bluetooth can.  Zoom out: Apple hasn’t commented on the augmented reality possibilities of AirTags.</description>

  <title>Basecamp Joins Coinbase in Banning Social or Political Talk at Work</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2574%2Fworkplace_politics.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; You can imagine the conversations on Election Day… Tyler Denk on Twitter After Fried announced Basecamp's new policy, Armstrong tweeted: "Another mission focused company 👏 it takes courage in these times." And we're done with it on our company Basecamp account where the work happens." Zoom out: While they haven't gone as far as Coinbase or Basecamp, other tech companies have put up guardrails around what employees can or cannot talk about in internal chats. Some tech leaders, like Facebook cofounder and current Asana CEO Dustin Moskovitz, said instead of pushing uncomfortable issues to the sidelines, companies should "actively create spaces for these conversations." In 2019, Google discouraged employees from talking politics in company forums.  But very few expected when, on Monday, Fried posted a blog on the company website in which he banned "societal and political discussions" from Basecamp's internal chats.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How Do I Overcome Imposter Syndrome? </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ask Kate for advice here. Q: How do you know when it’s time to leave a job? How often do you believe this to be true?" If it's because of a lack of skills, I try to do the work to gain those qualifications. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. Often, we talk to ourselves in a way that we wouldn't tolerate from anyone else. Be kind to yourself and work on creating a healthy mental dialogue about any mistakes you make.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Andrew Ross Sorkin</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4914%2Fandrew_ross_sorkin.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I work 80+ hours a week and I've always done it because I love it.  What is the dumbest thing you made your parents buy for you as a kid? I convinced my father, based on my track record of making money trading cards, to invest in a case of Fleer Ultra baseball cards. It isn't that he is intimidating as a person; it is that he is so smart and deep on so many different topics. So I'm going to try to figure out how to do a lot more of my work with my family within reach and to be more strategic about travel, work dinners, etc.  You can only do one: writing for the New York Times, TV anchoring, or producing (co-creating Billions for Showtime, developing a GameStop film for HBO). We still have the cards if anyone wants to buy them.</description>

  <title>Hot Rod Charlie and His Five Best Human Friends Have Big Kentucky Derby Dreams</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4917%2Fhot_rod_charlie.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, as the friends traveled the country over the last year to watch Chuck run and also perhaps enjoy a few beers, they never expected the horse to end up qualifying for the most elite horse race in the world. After their first two horses didn’t work out, they found Hot Rod Charlie, the horse that currently has the fourth-best odds to win the Kentucky Derby this Saturday. Baby Chuck via Patrick O'Neill The people’s horseO’Neill said that the Boat Racing crew has received a lot of support from family and friends, but also from people they’ve never met. In every good horse movie—Seabiscuit, Hidalgo, Racing Stripes—there’s a brooding protagonist who, throughout everything, believes their horse can win. He’d seen the way betting on horse racing had driven wedges between families and friends in the past, even his own family at times. To even be considered for the big day, the horse has to be three years old, which means every horse running this year’s race was one of the 19,664 registered Thoroughbreds born in 2018. Patrick O’Neill grew up watching horse races and has always loved the sport. The crew, most of whom went into finance after graduating, approached wiggling into the high-dollar sport sort of like a hedge fund, pooling their money to own 25% of Chuck (O’Neill said we could call the horse by his nickname because we’re cool).</description>
