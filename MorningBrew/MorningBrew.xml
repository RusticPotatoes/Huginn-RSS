The BAYC Instagram account was hacked yesterday morning and a fake ad tricked users into clicking a link that gave hackers access to their digital wallets. The coach said the school violated his rights to religious expression; the school contends it couldn‚Äôt allow the prayers to continue, since they could be perceived as an endorsement of religion. The judge determined that Trump failed to hand over documents related to an investigation by New York‚Äôs attorney general, who is looking into whether Trump inflated asset values in his financial statements. The Supreme Court heard opening arguments yesterday in a case brought by a public high school football coach in Washington state, who was suspended from his job for leading prayers on the field after games. The former president will have to fork over $10,000 a day in fines after being held in contempt of court by a New York judge. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}Subscribeüí∞ Things could get expensive for Donald Trump.</description>

  <title>GM officially announced an electrified Corvette</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Let‚Äôs see that executive order first, Joe.The new ‚ÄòVette will join the growing list of notorious ,engine-revving, sleeveless-shirt-wearing-macho-dude vehicles being electrified. ‚ÄîMM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! GM President Mark Reuss said that Chevy will sell an ‚Äúelectrified‚Äù (AKA hybrid, probably) Corvette next year, and eventually make it all-electric. GM said last June it would invest $35 billion through 2025 to boost EV- and autonomous vehicle (AV) tech, including spending $7 billion to build a Michigan battery plant and update other factories in the state for EV production. Last August, President Biden even joked during a speech, ‚ÄúWhen they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it.‚Äù Last July, Dodge said it would release an EV muscle car in 2024. There‚Äôs been a lot of anticipation for the iconic sports car‚Äôs non-gas version since GM said in January 2021 it would commit to exclusively selling EVs by 2035. Zoom out: Legacy automakers are betting it all on the electric game. And Ford slapped the Mustang name on its first electric SUV in 2019.</description>

  <title>Twitter and Elon Musk agree to $44 billion deal to take the company private.</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cb9a8a882c5c87268247c5399dab7b125ece8666-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. People in the ‚Äúeveryone is overreacting‚Äù camp say that Elon‚Äôs Twitter will be a series of marginal tweaks and endless compromises that may not move the needle one way or the other. With Twitter treading water, some tech analysts, such as Stratechery‚Äôs Ben Thompson, say that Musk‚Äîwho has a history of creating really valuable companies‚Äîcould unlock Twitter‚Äôs potential by better monetizing Twitter‚Äôs influential user base consisting of leaders in tech, media, and finance. Further reading: 1) Everything Elon Musk said he wants to change about Twitter and 2) a grand theory of what Elon‚Äôs up to with Twitter. Putting all of the control of Twitter in the hands of one person‚Äîlet alone one with a variety of business interests around the globe‚Äîwould be just as damaging, critics argue.</description>

A spokesperson for Esso, an Exxon subsidiary that placed the order, said the company had made the purchase before Russia launched its invasion and had no plans to buy more Russian oil. Greenpeace Norway leader Frode Pleym said the action was in protest of Norway buying Russian oil, ‚Äúwhich we know finances Putin‚Äôs warfare.‚Äù What you‚Äôre looking at: Environmental activists chained themselves to a tanker that was offloading its cargo of 105,000+ tons of Russian oil in a Norway port.</description>

They‚Äôre the most senior-ranking US officials to visit the city since Russia‚Äôs invasion, though many top European leaders have already been to Kyiv to talk with Zelensky. Shanghai authorities were seen erecting green fences around residential areas in an apparent attempt to keep people in the locked-down city from leaving their homes. Apparently Musk‚Äôs ability to come up with $46.5 billion in financing changed leadership‚Äôs thinking from vehemently opposed to ‚ÄúOK, maybe we should negotiate.‚Äù Twitter is reevaluating Elon Musk‚Äôs bid to buy the company for $43 billion, the WSJ reported.</description>

  <title>NYC's salary transparency law faces pushback from businesses</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeNew York City‚Äôs monumental pay transparency law is set to take effect on May 15, meaning that nearly every company operating in the city will have to include a pay range for all open job listings. Critics of the amendment said these employees‚Äîincluding those in the food services and retail industries‚Äîare some of the city‚Äôs most marginalized workers who are most in need of pay transparency. During testimony over the amendment, some small-business advocates also claimed the law would allow larger companies to easily outbid them for talented hires. While the law is still set to go into effect on May 15, the amended bill is currently in committee. But a proposed amendment to the law‚Äîsupported by large business groups and under consideration by the city council‚Äîcould limit its scope, create room for loopholes, and delay its implementation until November. ‚ÄîMK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In a letter to the City Council, the Partnership for New York City (a powerful business group) criticized it for lacking input from the employers it would affect. But radical transparency has proven effective at addressing the wage gap and giving employees an idea of what their work is worth. In the original wording of the amendment, businesses with 15 or fewer employees would be exempt‚Äîa change that would have removed around 58,000 NYC companies and 500,000 employees from the scope of the law. That‚Äôs a big deal, as pay transparency laws exist largely to address racial and gender pay gaps.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Instead of Germany‚Äôs economy growing by 3% this year, it would shrink by 2%, amounting to one of the worst recessions in the country since the financial crisis. As a result, cutting off Russian gas would force some of Germany‚Äôs industrial production to shut down and put an estimated 400,000+ people out of work. ‚ÄîNF German businesses would face their ‚Äúworst crisis since the Second World War‚Äù if a gas embargo were put into effect, Martin Bruderm√ºller, the CEO of chemicals giant BASF, warned. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an alternative energy source.‚Äù Big picture: With an immediate gas embargo seemingly off the table, Europe is trying to get creative to reduce its consumption of Russian energy. But since then, Germany has become even more dependent on Russian gas; as it wound down other power sources, such as nuclear and coal, it didn‚Äôt build up enough alternatives to replace them.</description>

  <title>NYC's salary transparency law faces pushback from businesses</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeNew York City‚Äôs monumental pay transparency law is set to take effect on May 15, meaning that nearly every company operating in the city will have to include a pay range for all open job listings. Critics of the amendment said these employees‚Äîincluding those in the food services and retail industries‚Äîare some of the city‚Äôs most marginalized workers who are most in need of pay transparency. During testimony over the amendment, some small-business advocates also claimed the law would allow larger companies to easily outbid them for talented hires. While the law is still set to go into effect on May 15, the amended bill is currently in committee. But a proposed amendment to the law‚Äîsupported by large business groups and under consideration by the city council‚Äîcould limit its scope, create room for loopholes, and delay its implementation until November. ‚ÄîMK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! In a letter to the City Council, the Partnership for New York City (a powerful business group) criticized it for lacking input from the employers it would affect. But radical transparency has proven effective at addressing the wage gap and giving employees an idea of what their work is worth. In the original wording of the amendment, businesses with 15 or fewer employees would be exempt‚Äîa change that would have removed around 58,000 NYC companies and 500,000 employees from the scope of the law. That‚Äôs a big deal, as pay transparency laws exist largely to address racial and gender pay gaps.</description>

  <title>Why Germany can‚Äôt quit Russian gas</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. That toll: The country‚Äôs central bank reported yesterday that an embargo on Russian gas would plunge it into a recession; Instead of Germany‚Äôs economy growing by 3% this year, it would shrink by 2%, amounting to one of the worst recessions in the country since the financial crisis. As a result, cutting off Russian gas would force some of Germany‚Äôs industrial production to shut down and put an estimated 400,000+ people out of work. ‚ÄîNF ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have an alternative energy source.‚Äù German businesses would face their ‚Äúworst crisis since the Second World War‚Äù if a gas embargo were put into effect, the CEO Martin Bruderm√ºller of chemicals giant BASF warned. Big picture: With an immediate gas embargo seemingly off the table, Europe is trying to get creative to reduce its consumption of Russian energy. But since then, Germany has become even more dependent on Russian gas as it wound down other power sources, such as nuclear and coal, but didn‚Äôt build up enough alternatives to replace them.</description>

Considering there was no political discussion around Disney World‚Äôs special tax status until very recently, the move is widely seen as retaliation for Disney‚Äôs criticism of a Florida law that restricts discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation in some classrooms. Under the deal it worked out with Florida, Disney is allowed to build new structures without local approval and is exempted from certain environmental and wastewater codes. Disney‚Äôs been operating the special administrative zone, called the Reedy Creek Improvement District, for 55 years. David Ramba, executive director of the Florida Association of Special Districts, told CNBC that he hasn‚Äôt seen any special districts get dissolved that didn‚Äôt want to be dissolved, not to mention one run by a $222 billion corporation. ‚ÄîNF css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>
