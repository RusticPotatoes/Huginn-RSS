Even short breaks can help the brain "reset" and improve focus during meetings.  </description>

  <title>Pew: 91% of US Adults Now Support Legalized Marijuana in Some Form</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3946%2Fnug_rocket.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018, and Mexico could follow soon. Legalization can bring big economic opportunity: The US marijuana industry already supports 300,000+ full-time jobs—more than the number of dentists in the country. Bottom line: "Legalization will eventually win, and the vast majority of states, if not all, will soon join the ranks of the legalizers," Vox writes.  In their latest survey, Pew found that 60% of US adults now support legalized recreational and medical use and an additional 31% back medical marijuana. And a lack of federal standards has led to inconsistency around testing, labeling, and marketing.</description>

  <title>Pew: 91% of US Adults Now Support Legalized Marijuana in Some Form</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3946%2Fnug_rocket.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018, and Mexico could follow soon. This month, New Mexico became the 17th state to allow recreational use. Even the South is cracking; starting in July, Virginia will allow recreational use. Tightly regulated distribution with restrictions on marketing, slow rollouts in some provinces, and less demand than expected have hurt. But success isn't a sure bet. Legalization can bring big economic opportunity: The US marijuana industry already supports 300,000+ full-time jobs—more than the number of dentists in the country. And a lack of federal standards has led to inconsistency around testing, labeling, and marketing.</description>

  <title>Apple Music Claims to Pay Artists Twice as Much as Spotify</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4766%2Fpenny_music_notes.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plus, Spotify has more streamers who listen to more songs, so while Apple may pay more per stream, it doesn’t pay more in total. The answer has to do with how the music biz operates: Streaming services pay rights holders (typically, record labels), instead of sending artists a direct deposit.</description>

Dogecoin’s ascent has been powered by a rabid online community led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who frequently publishes memes about dogecoin on his Twitter account.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Bridget Connelly</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4757%2Fbridget_connelly.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was recently thinking about rereading it.   Luna Bay was "born in Chicago" and is the first woman-founded-and-led hard kombucha brand on the market. So I love making a ginger lemon mezcal Booch-a-Rita. What's your favorite flavor of Luna Bay? What song would you say describes Luna Bay? We are really fortunate that we have amazing distributors that are empowering us and really want to support [women-led] brands. It wasn't until she found herself in San Diego, a hub for hard kombucha and craft beer, that she had the idea to start Luna Bay Booch and enlisted her business partner and childhood friend, Claire Ridge, to help. At first, I would take that personally because I did sign up for this.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Chasing Down Receipts </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would also assume that before you can take a single day off you would have to make that request to your manager. Your manager has to make a judgment every time a direct report makes a PTO request. When an employee requests time off, the request must always honor the company's general PTO policy. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. —AnonymousI don't think that you "should" feel guilty about requesting time off with just three months under your belt.</description>

  <title>Should the Government Have Paused the J&amp;J Vaccine?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3759%2Fvaccine_clock.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Finally, US health regulators, by seeking to avoid a credibility crisis, may have just invited one in.    On Monday, the CDC and FDA recommended pausing Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine while they investigate reports of rare blood clots.  A YouGov poll found that the perception of safety of the J&amp;J vaccine dropped 15 percentage points after officials suspended it.  Instilling confidence in vaccines is their No. 1 priority, and right now... 538's Nate Silver, one of the top critics of the government's decision, suggested that regulators could have said they're monitoring the situation and not paused vaccinations, or could have stopped giving J&amp;J to young women, who appear to be most at risk of developing the rare blood clots.  The argument against a pauseAgencies said they paused the rollout out of an "abundance of caution."</description>

Its two-tone paint job is cool, but the most interesting part of the EQS is what it means for other legacy car companies trying to transition away from combustion engines. Zoom out.
