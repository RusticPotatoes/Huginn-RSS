  <title>France Starts Mandating Vaccination for Entry to Cultural Venues</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5861%2Fno_vaccine_no_entry.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The US federal government hasn’t introduced any vaccine requirements for businesses, and it likely won’t take any steps until the FDA grants full approval to at least one of the shots. The vaccine strategy has resulted in two things:It has angered a lot of people: More than 100,000 protestors hit the streets last weekend, saying the vaccine rules infringed on their rights.   Bottom line: From $1 million lotteries to calling in Olivia Rodrigo for a PSA, US officials have offered loads of carrots to push the vaccine-hesitant to get their shots.</description>

  <title>Netflix Moves Into Video Games As Subscription Growth Slows</title>

  <title>So the Billionaires Went to Space. Now What?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5846%2Fjeff_bezos_blue_origin_n.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its big report on the space industry, Morgan Stanley identified the 10 drivers of a space economy that could grow to $1 trillion by 2040. Reality check: While space tourism news has gotten the recent buzz, it’s just a small slice of the overall space market, which is currently dominated by SpaceX. After he landed yesterday, Bezos said sales for private seats on Blue Origin flights (two more of which are planned for this year) are already approaching $100 million. Now that Bezos and Richard Branson have both completed their flights, what’s next for the space tourism industry?</description>

Zoom out: The Covid-19 recession ended an economic boom that began in June 2009 and lasted 128 months, the longest US economic expansion on record.  The US government is certainly acting like the recession is long gone. Let's start the clock again. The federal eviction moratorium ends on July 31.</description>

  <title>Facebook and Biden in War of Words Over Vaccine Misinformation</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5820%2Fgood_will_hunting.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The social media company pushed back on Saturday against increasing criticism from the White House that the company is allowing the spread of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation. More than 97% of new hospitalizations from the Delta variant are of people who’ve not been vaccinated, the agency said. “The fact is that vaccine acceptance among Facebook users in the US has increased,” the company wrote, citing a study that showed vaccine acceptance among FB users has jumped 10–15 percentage points since January.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...NFL Legend Ndamukong Suh</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5819%2Fndamukong_suh.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s one of those things where I don't think you need to bet all of your money on one thing, but I do think you need to have exposure to it. I had to ask myself, “How do I understand what a budget is?” I remember back in the day a long snapper named Don Muhlbach was one of the few guys in the locker room I would talk to about finance, where he was at with his business, and who he aspired to be. Four sacks in a playoff game or a Super Bowl win—that’d be the best. Some of them I've already accomplished so that’s probably why I didn’t pick them.  No. 1 draft pick Trevor Lawrence is getting his signing bonus paid out in cryptocurrency.  There’s for sure more conversations on those topics in the locker room compared to 2010 when I first got in the league. I don’t see myself putting my salary fully into bitcoin. If you could own one building what would it be? Now, it’s on Reddit and you see all the news about GameStop so I think it’s seen as more “cool” to talk about it and be in the know.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: How Many Credit Cards Is too Many?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5817%2Fcredit_cards.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Credit card rewards can pack a serious punch. —Eduardo from New YorkThe question isn’t how many credit cards you should have, but rather how much of your total credit limit you’re using. If you have just one credit card with a $1,000 limit, stay sub-$300, even when you pay in full and on time. How many credit cards should I have, and is it OK to close one if I never used it and have no balance?</description>
