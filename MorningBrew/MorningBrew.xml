  <title>Musk Faces Legal Questions Over SolarCity Acquisition</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/QLlbsC0Pu2iYULBry4/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As Reuters asks, “Does Elon Musk control Tesla Inc., or does Tesla control Elon Musk?” so how was this bad for Tesla shareholders exactly? Musk didn’t need much due diligence before buying SolarCity—after all, his cousins founded it in 2006 and Musk served as the chairman.  The detailsThe lawsuit alleges that Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity reeked with conflicts of interest and that Musk failed to disclose some liquidity problems at SolarCity.</description>

  <title>Branson in Space: Risky or Reckless?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F662%2Frichard_branson.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His personal ambitions are intertwined with the company’s—this space flight was inevitable.    Micron shares fell more than 6% following the news of Appleton’s death. A 2011 study found that CEOs with licenses to pilot small aircraft (an activity 30x more dangerous than driving a car) are 40% more likely to make a corporate acquisition and 15% more likely to take on greater leverage. The company has completed more than 20 test flights, but the mission has been delayed by technical issues and a pilot died in a test flight in 2014. Bottom line: When Richard Branson decided to create a space company, it’s probably because he wanted to go to space.</description>

Joe Biden is tired of other presidents getting all the “trustbuster” recognition in the history books.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: When Is the Right Time to Become a Manager?</title>

It’s not like anyone says, “I want to be a manager when I grow up!” Now, my boss wants to put me into a manager role.  Of course, while managing can be extremely rewarding, it certainly isn’t for everyone. It’s totally normal for you to feel nervous about becoming a manager. I don’t think I’m ready or qualified for the role. Ask Kate here. Something bothering you at work? Let us know what happens!

  <title>Icebreakers With...Malcolm Gladwell</title>

Does that preparation always take 10,000 hours? If I did not have to sleep, I would sleep anyway. Sleep is literally my favorite thing to do. 10 years down the line, which activity will passengers in driverless cars do most frequently: work, sleep, chat, or something else? My zombies would be Canadian, like me. If you had to make your own zombie movie, what would your zombies be like? I mean, come on. And then ask yourself: Is that thing you remember so well measurable and quantifiable? I always run before dinner. When I finish a run I usually think only about food. When did you realize The Little Mermaid was not like other Disney movies?  This interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. They would be unfailingly polite. And comfort the afflicted!” I would repeat the greatest of all journalism dictums: “Afflict the comfortable!</description>

  <title>10-Year Treasury Yield Plunges to Its Lowest Level since February</title>

  <title>China Tightens Regulations On Its Tech Companies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5686%2Fwall_street_bull_and_chinese_flag.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The change would force companies classified under a certain corporate structure (known as the Variable Interest Entity model if you want to sound smart af) to seek the government’s approval before listing shares in the US or Hong Kong. Hong Kong could soon become the only place for non-Chinese investors to buy stakes in Chinese tech companies as regulators throttle firms listed in the US.
