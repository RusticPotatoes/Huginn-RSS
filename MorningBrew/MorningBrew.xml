  <title>Wall Street Mystery Swirls Over Massive Block Trades</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FxThtavoJ6AX69jbG2A%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A block trade is when huge amounts of shares trade hands, typically through negotiation outside of the open market to keep stock prices stable. Basically, what allegedly happened is that Archegos's lenders forced it to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares on Friday. In Saturday’s Brew, we noted that shares in Discovery and ViacomCBS had plunged on Friday following analyst downgrades.</description>

  <title>Ever Given, the Ship Stuck in the Suez Canal, Has Been Partially Refloated</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4525%2Fship_stuck_in_suez_canal.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line: If the Ever Given can fully break free today and allow traffic to pass, the shipping industry can avoid the worst scarring, according to the NYT. You can get deep about it.  The Ever Given, a mind-bogglingly huge container ship that’s been blocking the Suez Canal for almost a week, holding up an estimated $9.6 billion in goods a day, is way less stuck than it used to be.   But that hasn’t stopped everyone from having a little fun at the ship’s expense—okay, a lot of fun.

  <title>Germany Avoids “Baby Bust” With Rising Birth Rates</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4520%2Fbaby_in_hospital.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This jump in births runs counter to the current and even pre-pandemic fertility rates in the rest of Europe, the US, and other wealthy nations: There will be 300,000 fewer births this year in the US, according to estimates. No one’s totally sure, but some economists are pointing to Kurzarbeit, Germany’s state-funded safety net.</description>
