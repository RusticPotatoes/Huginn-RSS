  <title>Swedish King Says His Country "Failed" Pandemic Response</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3459/king_carl_xvi_gustaf.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf said his country "failed" its pandemic response.     Refresher: While other countries enacted strict lockdowns when the pandemic began, Sweden gambled on an open economy and voluntary guidelines, with the goal of eventually reaching herd immunity. If it's approved, Swedish healthcare workers get dibs around Christmas.</description>

  <title>Japanese Appliance Startup Pops 88% in Public Market Debut</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3449/balmuda_toaster.jpeg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bottom line: There wasn't a market for high-end toasters until Balmuda showed what was possible. It comes with a little teaspoon of water, which helps seal in moisture. That sexy little oven above will set you back $224, and Balmuda’s “The Gohan” rice cooker costs $400.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6wrpEqt4VpwonyNi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Massachusetts securities regulators filed a complaint against the popular stock trading platform Robinhood for prioritizing “its revenue over the best interest of its customers,” according to documents reviewed by the WSJ.     Robinhood’s easy-to-navigate platform has attracted over 13 million insanely active traders.</description>

  <title>U.S. Labels Vietnam, Switzerland Currency Manipulators</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lptjRBxFKCJmFoibP3/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury labeled the European country and Vietnam currency manipulators.   Why it matters: Labeling countries as currency manipulators is rarer than a Federer two-handed backhand, and it reflects the tougher trade stance taken by the Trump administration toward both allies and rivals.   What is currency manipulation?</description>

  <title>Texas Attorney General Leads Antitrust Suit Against Google Focusing on its Ad Business</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriffhhxhmuQP2Xgk/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The suit claims that Google is the Joey Chestnut to the digital advertising industry's plate of hot dogs.   Yesterday, a group of state attorneys general led by Texas said they're taking legal action against Google for, you guessed it, engaging in anticompetitive practices.   Zoom out: If this feels like déjà sue, you’d be correct.</description>

  <title>Brew’s Bookshelf: Holiday Gift Guide</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3447/holiday_books.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Henry Stockwell, copywriter: E: A Novel by Matt Beaumont This novel is really just a collection of fake emails from a fictional London ad agency at the start of the 21st century, when I guess ad agencies still operated somewhat like Mad Men?   Milo Booke, product manager: One Billion Americans by Matthew Yglesias  Yglesias lays out a vision of an America that reorients its policies and culture toward growing our population massively, giving us more economic and diplomatic heft and influence in a world of other ascendant global powers.   Mainly, this book takes anime seriously as a “media success story,” just as companies like Netflix are starting to do.   Eliza Carter, daily newsletter writer: Billion Dollar Loser by Reeves Wiedeman  You know the rise and fall of WeWork was nuts. If you’re a movie buff, this is a must read. Hayden Field, Emerging Tech Brew writer: Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener  A beautifully-written memoir about the author’s move from the New York publishing industry to the Silicon Valley tech world. This is the main question asked throughout the book and I believe that it guides the reader to find that answer. Buy it here. How much of it is what we really know and want versus what’s taught to us?   Kate Noel, VP &amp; head of people ops: Untamed by Glennon Doyle  A memoir that really peels back the layers of what it means to be a woman, mother, and friend in today’s society. But this up-close account from NYMag reporter Reeves Wiedeman reveals the nuttery to be even nuttier than you imagined.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett, David Solomon Urge Congress to Extend PPP for Small Businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3431/warren_buffett.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  PPP has been criticized for fraud and not actually going to small businesses. It's a $525 billion government program intended to help small businesses keep workers on payroll. In an interview with CNBC yesterday morning, legendary investor Warren Buffett urged Congress to pass legislation to help small businesses stay afloat. Help could be on the way if Congress gets the job done.   A real-world example: This summer, American Airlines was able to raise $2.5 billion from selling bonds even as it was bleeding $58 million/day.</description>

  <title>Christmas Markets Need a Christmas Miracle</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3429/santa_claus.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The situation is even tougher for vendors at San Francisco's Dickens Fair, which is a historic market that requires vendors to meet certain standards of "authenticity." His experience implementing health and safety protocols at the flea market helped him open the holiday market in-person safely. Michael Berman, who created the market 16 years ago, also runs D.C.'s Eastern Market and had to adapt this spring to pandemic-era guidelines. While the Christkindlmarket in Chicago is showcasing about 50 exhibitors online (close to the number it welcomed at its in-person market), most are "hanging on for dear life," according to Kate Bleeker, director of expansion and market development.   Vendors need help Small businesses that sell at markets often depend on a handful of in-person events for the majority of their annual sales. In San Francisco, the Great Dickens Christmas Fair also canceled its in-person market and set up the Dickens Fair at Home with an online shop and virtual experiences.   At Bryant Park, foot traffic and sales are estimated at a third of previous years’ levels, and Vagianos said vendors are worried."    But this year, the markets in D.C., San Francisco, and NYC currently have anywhere from a third to half the typical number of vendors exhibiting.   After watching in-person events get postponed the start of the pandemic and reconstitute on Zoom over the summer, Christmas markets began having tough conversations—and we're not talking about the final design for the collectible 2020 candle holder.   Other markets decided to open...</description>

It's expected to get approval. The remaining challenges Spoilage: Pfizer's vaccine needs to maintain -94°F, and although the company has equipped shipping containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled temperature sensors, it's expected that some doses won't survive the journey.  </description>
