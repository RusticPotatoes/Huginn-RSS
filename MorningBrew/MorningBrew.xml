  <title>What's Up With the Child Tax Credit?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5777%2Firs_building.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taxpayers who claimed the child tax credit on their 2020 returns—or 2019 for those who haven’t yet filed for 2020—should be all set to receive monthly payments. The monthly max payment is $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. Until then, chat up a tax pro if:Your income increased significantly in 2021You’re concerned about a higher-than-usual tax bill next yearYou take turns with someone in claiming the child tax creditYour child turns 6 or 18 in 2021You’re too late to unenroll from the first payment, but you can discontinue the rest here. Parents who aren’t required to file taxes can sign up for payments on the non-filer portal. You’ll get the max payment when your AGI is below... You’ll get something when your AGI is below:$240,000 and you’re single$440,000 and you’re married filing jointly$240,000 and you’re a head of householdYou can calculate exactly how much you’ll get here. The IRS is looking back at your most recent return to calculate your monthly payment, but the actual tax credit amount is based on your 2021 situation. They’ll get the other half when they file their 2021 taxes next year.</description>

  <title>With the US Fully Open for Business, Inflation Hits Highest Rate in 13 Years</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5756%2Finflation_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used cars are the star of this category, with their price increases accounting for more than a third of June’s total price hikes. Prices that are booming thanks to supply shortages. Prices that will remain higher permanently. As always with inflation stories, we must close by turning to the Fed, whose main job is to keep prices stable. As we mentioned, the bulk of the price increases were in sectors battered by the pandemic (hospitality) or those battling supply shortages (used cars). Prices that plummeted early in the pandemic and are surging to catch up.</description>

Either way, Denver businesses are happy to play host. Zoom out: A tourism board in Georgia said losing the game cost the state $100+ million in economic activity, though MLB estimates are slightly lower.</description>

  <title>This Year’s All-Star Game Gets More Political</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5751%2Fall-star_game_in_denver.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backstory: In April, the MLB said it was moving the All-Star Game from Georgia to Denver due to Georgia’s new voting law. Either way, Denver businesses are happy to play host. Zoom out: A tourism board in Georgia said losing the game cost Georgia $100+ million in economic activity, though MLB estimates are slightly lower.</description>

  <title>Branson in Space: Risky or Reckless?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F662%2Frichard_branson.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;His personal ambitions are intertwined with the company’s—this space flight was inevitable.    Micron shares fell more than 6% following the news of Appleton’s death. A 2011 study found that CEOs with licenses to pilot small aircraft (an activity 30x more dangerous than driving a car) are 40% more likely to make a corporate acquisition and 15% more likely to take on greater leverage. The company has completed more than 20 test flights, but the mission has been delayed by technical issues and a pilot died in a test flight in 2014. Bottom line: When Richard Branson decided to create a space company, it’s probably because he wanted to go to space.</description>
