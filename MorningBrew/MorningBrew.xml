  <title>Supreme Court Hands Down Major Rulings on Farms, Free Speech, and Fannie and Freddie</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5535%2Fsupreme_court.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Supreme Court didn’t buy that, but did concede that the structure of the agency that oversees Fannie and Freddie is unconstitutional. Yesterday, the Supreme Court struck down a regulation that allowed union organizers to meet with agricultural workers during their lunch breaks and for one hour before and after their shifts, on up to 120 days a year.  Bottom line: Because Levy didn’t bully anyone or post her frustrations during school, SCOTUS said she had the right to be an angry teen. The school banned Levy from cheer for a full year and her (clearly cool) dad got the ACLU involved, claiming that the school violated her First Amendment rights.</description>

  <title>US Likely Won’t Hit Vaccination Goal by Fourth of July, Says White House</title>

For its part, the NCAA claims that compensating student athletes would undermine the “amateur” flavor of college sports, damaging fans' enjoyment of the product. At least seven states have passed bills allowing college athletes to make money from their names, images, and likenesses that go into effect next week. Yesterday, the US Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the NCAA cannot stop colleges from compensating student athletes, as long as that compensation is tied to education.</description>

If more justices adopt Kavanaugh's aggressive stance, “It could only be a matter of time before all of the NCAA's restrictions on compensation are struck down as antitrust violations,” Tulane sports law administrator Gabe Feldman told the NYT.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4692%2Fbudget_scale.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer your question, those sweet, sweet tax benefits of 401(k) and IRA retirement plans come in two flavors: traditional and Roth.
