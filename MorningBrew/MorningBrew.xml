  <title>California Drought Could Cause Wide-Ranging Industry Problems</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4436%2Fdrought_in_california.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The state of play: California Gov. Gavin Newsom has put 41 counties under a state of emergency in an attempt to drastically limit water use. Some scientists say the region is facing the worst drought in centuries. Officials are predicting the water level of Lake Oroville, the Beyoncé of California lakes, to hit a record low in August. California accounts for 80% of the US' almond supply, but because of shrinking water allocations, some farmers are simply bulldozing those notoriously thirsty almond trees.

  <title>Hack Shuts Down JBS Meat Processing Operations</title>

  <title>Stock Analysis 101</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5302%2Fchart.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find company financials through the SEC EDGAR portal. If the same company is trading at $20 per share, the PE ratio is 20. It’s more about finding patterns in the stock price that investors can exploit. Here are some signs of a company with a blossoming future:Lasting edge in the market: You want to invest in a company that has some competitive advantage in its sector. It’s the same thing with picking stocks: You want to invest in companies that are part of a growing industry. It’s OK if you’re feeling this way, because there’s more to a stock price than the numbers. Vincent Glode, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told the Brew that looking beyond the numbers can help you feel more confident about the stock. You won’t find any analysis there, so head over to a site like Yahoo Finance to see what investors are thinking. Chat with a financial advisor about the most responsible way to fit stock trading into your portfolio. Then, move onto valuation ratios, which compare a company’s financial results to its price in the market. Do your own researchAt first, financial statements can look like they’re written in Klingon. Financial market experts agree that identifying stocks that’ll beat the overall market is hard. Review the numbersNo matter your approach, it’s a good idea to take a look at the company’s financials before investing. In general, you want a quick ratio higher than 1. They care less about the company’s intrinsic value and more about how the stock price will shift in the future. See what analysts—and even your friends—are saying about the company’s future in qualitative terms. Fundamental analysis involves determining the company’s intrinsic value from the bottom up, from examining historical financial statements to imagining the company’s future. Analysts often associate industries with specific ratios that best depict a company’s financials.  Put it all togetherThis is where investment analysts take their research, create a financial model, and forecast the company’s future financials before making a trading decision. That’s why you often see higher trading volume around earnings reports. Analysts from major financial institutions put out their predictions ahead of companies’ earnings announcements, and a company’s goal is for these metrics to meet or exceed analyst expectations. Much of what’s built into a company’s stock price is investors’ expectations of the future, from new product lines to shifting market conditions. Investment analysts have already crunched the numbers, so you can put away your TI-83. If the company’s market cap—or total value in the market—is $50 million and sales were $5 million for the last 12-month period, the PSR is 10. “Psychological views of companies can last a very long time.”</description>

  <title>China Adopts Three-Child Policy Rule to Boost Population</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/cAMfDqovnTpqDhm1OR/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The US population grew at its slowest rate since the Great Depression from 2010–2020, and its birth rate declined for the sixth straight year last year.  Why it matters: Declining population growth has profound implications for a country's economic success.     Zoom out: While many parts of the world face stagnant population growth, others are making up for it. Bottom line: As much as the Chinese government wants to grow the country's share of the world population, it might be fighting a losing battle.</description>
