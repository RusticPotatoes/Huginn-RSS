  <title>US drops Covid testing requirement for international air travel</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. The Biden administration said that it’s dropping its international air travel testing requirement at 12:01am tomorrow, bringing one of the last remaining federal policies intended to curb the spread of Covid to an end. What that policy was: All international air passengers—regardless of citizenship or vaccination status—were required to test negative for Covid within one day of boarding a flight to the US. Dr. Vin Gupta, a former health adviser to Biden, argued that it’s “well past time to drop the testing requirement to international travelers to the US” in a WSJ interview. Domestic air travel has mostly recovered to pre-Covid levels, but international travel has not rebounded in the same way. —NF So is the virus going to rip because of this?

The US Travel Association estimated that ending the testing rule could spur an additional $9 billion in travel spending for the rest of the year. American Airlines CEO Robert Isom called the policy “nonsensical” last week, citing the fact that 75% of the countries the airline serves had dropped testing requirements. “It’s a real impediment to travel,” United CEO Scott Kirby told the WSJ last month.</description>

  <title>These influencers live trash-free in a garbage world</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/f0df0af96d4e134f66c125bedad8e176a4eb231f-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. ] I have always classified my zero waste journey within the confines of the waste that I can control,” she said. While they might not be able to control an oil company’s carbon emissions, they can control the packaging and trash coming in and out of their own house. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. “And so one great way to do that is just to make things look beautiful.” “I was spending so much time and effort reducing my trash just such a small amount when I could better use that effort in a much broader way,” Kellogg said. The zero waste influencers’ sunny attitude and clean minimalism make the lifestyle more desirable to their followers. If the zero waste space is gendered, then its marketing is too: The pastel colors and altruistic messaging is no doubt meant to appeal to women who still overwhelmingly make household spending decisions. One household might produce less garbage but that can feel like a drop in the bucket when structural reform is the only solution to climate change. The women who spoke to Morning Brew about their zero waste lifestyles—and the influencers are overwhelmingly women—described feeling an awakening to the waste around them, seeing clearly the plastic film on packaged food or wrapped around produce. For zero wasters like Singer, that’s okay: “I’m not going to tell them how to live their life. “Everybody can be zero waste. But she wants to show that sustainable living doesn’t have to look one certain way. Enough people are interested in buying zero waste products that Singer founded and opened the Package Free Shop in Brooklyn in 2017 where she sells unpackaged and low-waste products. Living zero waste can require bringing her own containers to restaurants and researching their sustainability values before sitting down. Zero waste influencers like Hammond are growing in number on TikTok and Instagram. Shoppers might be interested in glass bottling, metal straws, or stainless steel water bottles, but few will commit to a zero waste lifestyle. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. “It’s a form of social activity,” Ottman said. Although women and men equally believe climate change is real and caused by human behavior, women are more likely to fear it will harm them personally, a 2018 survey from the Yale School of the Environment found. “First, you just have to make people want to look and pay attention,” Singer said. “People who aren’t familiar with something are going to obviously say it’s hard,” Hammond said, referring to the labor and commitment zero waste living requires. “I control everything that I can to the best of my ability. One hundred companies, including top offenders ​​ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and Chevron, have created more than 70% of the planet’s greenhouse gas emissions: Individuals can do very little to stop that mass pollution, but something like an empty wastebasket can feel like a tangible solution.</description>

The hard pivot comes after Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith announced last week that the security company would start development of drones that could be operated by first responders and potentially used in schools to avoid another shooting like the recent one in Uvalde, Texas. —MM What changed? Axon’s ethics board, a group of experts in tech, privacy, and policing, sparred publicly with Smith over the idea, arguing that the drones could be used to over-police communities of color. In 2016, Smith even wrote a companion graphic novel exploring how the drone could stop a shooter. Nine members resigned yesterday over the drone plan.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Big picture: One reason for Musk’s fixation with bots might be that he encounters them far more than the average Twitter user—or even the average celebrity. If it gets tired of Musk’s lollygagging, Twitter could eventually sue to compel Musk to go through with the deal. In Musk’s most significant play yet to pull out of the deal, his lawyer sent a letter to Twitter accusing the company of denying Musk’s requests for more information about the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. —NF Musk has repeatedly argued that Twitter has a much bigger bot problem than it discloses, and is using that as justification to scuttle (or potentially renegotiate) his $44 billion purchase.

  <title>The UK launched a major test of the 4-day workweek</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/c02f91c79600ff85f88545dfb9f8da5ee5b30322-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. In January, there were just 1,700 jobs advertising a four-day workweek in the US for every 1 million posted. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Bottom line: For all the notable trials and tests of a shorter workweek, finding a job that actually implements one is extremely rare. Trials of lighter work schedules haven’t always been successful for both employees and employers, though: A two-year trial of a six-hour workday in one of Sweden’s largest cities in 2017 left workers happier, healthier, and more productive, but the practice was deemed too expensive due to the new hires needed to fill gaps in time. More than 3,300 workers will participate in the trial, making it the largest test of the four-day workweek. A six-month program that began in the UK on Monday will test the effects of the four-day workweek on thousands of workers across 70 companies. —MK But, if you’re one of the 92% of US employees who are into the idea and don’t want to wait for trial results, you may want to consider moving to France, where a 35-hour workweek cap has been the law since 2000. The results of the trial will be announced sometime in 2023. Several industries will be involved, including banking, health care, marketing, and retail—and through interviews, surveys, and internal productivity measures, researchers will determine if we have all been clocking in on Fridays for our whole adult lives for absolutely no reason.</description>

  <title>Elon Musk tries to squirm out of Twitter deal</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1e88ace89ad33182573bd0d97c83c87607e1f66c-1290x860.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Big picture: One reason for Musk’s fixation with bots might be that he encounters them far more than the average Twitter user—or even the average celebrity. If it gets tired of Musk’s lollygagging, Twitter could eventually sue to compel Musk to go through with the deal. In Musk’s most significant play yet to pull out of the deal, his lawyer sent a letter to Twitter accusing the company of denying Musk’s requests for more information about the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform. —NF Musk has repeatedly argued that Twitter has a much bigger bot problem than it discloses, and is using that as justification to scuttle (or potentially renegotiate) his $44 billion purchase. Twitter responded to Musk’s letter with a statement along the lines of, “No take-backs, pal.</description>

  <title>Axon pumps the brakes on taser drone it said could take down mass shooters</title>

The hard pivot comes after Axon founder and CEO Rick Smith announced last week that the security company would start development of drones that could be operated by first responders and potentially used in schools to avoid another shooting like the recent one in Uvalde, Texas. The plan, one of several “maybe add more weapons?” —MM What changed? The board, a group of experts in tech, privacy, and policing, sparred publicly with Smith over the idea, arguing that the drones could be used to over-police communities of color. -type solutions to mass shootings, caused nine members of the company’s ethics board to resign yesterday.</description>

  <title>"It ain't rocket science": How one FoodToker is making a career as a content creator</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1b91e7c4181dca8717c0ae9c5d148da3d7440235-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Today’s dish is shrimp tempura udon and food content creator H Woo Lee is explaining how to make it from scratch in a behind-the-scenes video. Lee says he and TikToker Sam Way were the first ones to create ASMR cooking videos for TikTok.Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. His videos are relaxing and stylish, concealing the hours of work he puts into creating TikToks for his 1 million followers. No one can taste my food,” Lee said. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. Like a lot of food influencers, Lee isn’t a professional chef. His ultimate goal is to open a restaurant one day so his fans can finally taste his food. “There’s only one way for anyone to differentiate themselves. It’s like a miniature store,” Kar Brulhart, a creator strategist said. “In-person dining, and like being a chef,” Lee said, “that’s my craft.” The 23 year old’s main channel has 92.6 million subscribers and makes at least $3 million per month from YouTube ads alone, per the analytics service SocialBlade. Creators like Lee are ditching the Instagram filters, highly posed pictures, and stylized lattes for content that feels more authentic. Lee compares being a content creator to being an Uber driver: He has the freedom to set his own work schedule, which is what he wanted for himself. These days successful creators are very knowledgeable in their respective fields while coming across as down to earth, but they deliver professional-grade content that is strategically planned and carefully edited, like Lee’s cooking videos. The rise of TikTok stars makes mastery of the app seem like an easy, glamorous, and highly rewarding side hustle, but for most creators, like Lee, that’s simply not true. “There’s so many creators coming into this space now,” Lee explained to Morning Brew. As a full-time creator, Lee makes ASMR-style videos (or to get technical: Autonomous Sensory Meridian) that feature elaborate dishes, like prosciutto arugula pizza and Peking duck, to stand out from his TikTok competitors. But first, he needs to continue producing good food and even better content until Gordon Ramsay comes knocking. It’s a laborious process that, for TikTok, was edited into a tidy 60-second video emphasizing the sounds of his kitchen: the boil of the broth, the sizzle of cooking oil, and Lee’s slurps as he eats his final product. He’s not just cooking intricate meals—he’s also his own planner, cameraman, video editor, and social media manager. His very first viral video had 10.6 millions of views, but even after being a full-time creator for almost a year and half, he still can’t recreate the recipe to that success every time.</description>
