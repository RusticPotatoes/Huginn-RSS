  <title>Origin Stories: July Fourth’s Favorite Companies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5659%2F2018_nathan_s_famous_hot_dog_eating_contest.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nathan’s Hot DogsYes, a guy named Nathan did actually start this company. Old Navy became the first clothing company to reach $1 billion in sales in its first four years of business. What’s up with the matching Old Navy shirts in every single one of our family pics? In 2012, Solo was acquired by Dart Container for $1 billion, and according to the company’s website, fans post 400,000+ photos with the iconic red cup every year.  Red Solo cupIt’s the early 1930s in Chicago, and disposable cups are all the rage after the city council banned the use of germy “common drinking cups” 20 years before. The contest, where competitors have 10 minutes to inhale as many hot dogs as they can, has aired live on ESPN since 2004. Why is Nathan's the first name you think of when you picture a hot dog? In 1916, Nathan Handwerker began selling hot dogs in New York’s Coney Island for five cents.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How to Address a Pay Gap Issue</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Hey Kate, I recently discovered that I am being paid 25%–33% less than my male colleagues working in the same position with the same level of education and work experience. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021.  If you don’t get a positive response, maybe it’s time to look for an employer that values your talents and experience. Be clear, specific, and confident!</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Beeple</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5657%2Fpicture_of_beeple.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's not a part of NFTs.What is the future of NFTs? NFTs will be part of your life, just because they'll be the easiest way to prove that you own things. This WENEW project is one new use case for NFTs. As more use cases come, more people will learn about this technology and see value in it for something that connects to their lives.  It's been really exciting to be a part of something that feels like it's the beginning. It’s still the most expensive NFT ever sold.  The other thing that is tough for people to understand is that one of the main aspects of ownership with many things is being able to restrict access to that thing. They’ll be attached to a bunch of different things that make it easy to prove that you are the one single person that has that thing.  You’ve had quite a year, selling an NFT for $69 million. It’s a super exciting time, and I feel very honored to be a part of that.</description>

  <title>Robinhood Announces IPO After $70 Million Finra Fine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2127%2Frobinhood_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, Robinhood wants you to buy into Robinhood’s IPO on Robinhood. In an unusual move, it’s setting aside 20%–35% of its Class A stock for its customers, as opposed to bankers. US-listed IPOs have already raised over $190 billion so far in 2021, more than 2020’s total.</description>

The relaxation of rules governing name, image, and likeness (NIL) allows college athletes to sign endorsement deals and make money off their fame for the first time, resulting in a “transcendent day for American sports,” Sports Illustrated writes.</description>

Bottom line: At 100 years old, the Communist Party remains a potent global force led by a president who could be the first since Mao to rule until he dies. Its caginess around the origins of Covid-19 has made things worse.</description>

  <title>SpaceX’s Starlink Internet Service Has 69,420 Users</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/fr0a9Np0PlcJTVevU5/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Musk said Starlink could make up to $30 billion in revenue per year—about 10 times the revenue of the rocket-launching side of SpaceX. Starlink provides internet via a network of over 1,500 satellites orbiting low enough for stargazers to spot them overhead.    But like cheap printers with expensive ink, Starlink hopes to recoup initial costs later on. 69,420, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said yesterday.</description>

Home prices in cities like Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle are all up more than 20% year over year. “People are kind of burnt out.” Sounds pretty bubbly, right? Another buyer in Austin, TX, bought two houses from the same seller so he could get the one he really wanted.</description>

Fast forward to yesterday, and United Airlines just placed its largest plane order ever and the biggest of any airline in a decade. One does not simply order 270 state-of-the-art planes worth more than $30 billion and then leave them unused in the hangar.</description>

  <title>Juul Agrees to Pay $40 million to Settle North Carolina Vaping Case</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5592%2Fjuul.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Altria, the tobacco giant that owns Marlboro, bought a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, Juul was valued at $38 billion. The same year, the FDA called teen vaping an “epidemic” and started to crack down on Juul and other e-cig companies. Although Juul insisted that its products were intended for adults, its marketing strategies said otherwise... as of last summer, Juul was facing 758 lawsuits across the US. Juul released fruit-flavored pods that went viral among teens (it's pulled most flavors since). That verdict is expected by September.</description>
