  <title>The SEC Threatens to Sue Coinbase</title>

That’s how Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong described the SEC’s latest crypto crackdown. In a blog post and a nowadays-mandatory Twitter thread, Coinbase executives said they don’t understand what grounds the SEC is suing them on, and that the SEC has refused to loop them in.</description>

  <title>Home, Sweet Futuristic, Home: The Rise of High-Tech Consumer Products</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7315%2Fstarship_technologies.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;) But what’s really important to keep in mind is that whether it’s tech that cleans or tech that drives you to work—it’s all here to make our lives easier. Ultrasonic recognition tech gives you complete control. In terms of recognition of obstacles in the home, for example, AI allows machines to take in complex data and make sense of it on the fly. Compared to just camera-based navigation, LiDAR allows for a level of precision that can help your tech move like it’s actually, truly smart. And while some people are still standing on street corners wondering why they can’t hail a flying taxi, we’re here to talk about the futuristic tech that can be in your home today.  And while this tech can tell a product where they are, it can also tell it where not to go.</description>

Lend would let Coinbase users earn interest by lending digital assets—specifically, a stablecoin called USD Coin—to others. That’s how Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong described the SEC’s latest crypto crackdown. According to Coinbase, the Wall Street regulator has sent the leading crypto exchange a “Wells notice” regarding its upcoming lending product, Lend.</description>

  <title>Your employees' mental health care starts with your own</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/mHwiw1aa0ztS6clQGy/giphy.gif?cid=790b761173866b309d7508c4d9912daf31a6174c564adcbd&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Take time off,” Hartless said.  With burnout on the rise, Hartless said it’s essential that companies give workers the ability to create boundaries. Make room beyond Zoom According to July’s Mental Health Index: US Worker Edition, which synthesized random survey results of 500 workers, the risk of generalized anxiety among US workers has risen 94% since July and 98% since the beginning of the pandemic. To combat that sense of unrelenting work, she said it’s important to let workers know that they can switch their cameras off during video calls, and take time off to tend to their own mental health. At Mitel, the company created a “Wellness Village,” crammed with employee resources, such as webinars where workers can vent about their struggles during the pandemic.  Hartless said her company has implored its leaders to “open the door” by addressing mental health; in one example, she recalled an executive who talked about his long battle with mental health for a group of employees. HR’s function as an emotional sounding board for employees has only intensified during the pandemic, despite the fact that HR professionals are also suffering.</description>
