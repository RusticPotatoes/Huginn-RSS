  <title>Conservative Social Platform Parler Is Spreading Election Misinformation</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3134/us-it-lifestyle-media-pol.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   Big picture: Compared to Twitter's 187 million daily users and Facebook properties’ 1.8 billion, Parler is still a small fish.   And now, election misinformation. Parler was envisioned as a libertarian platform for conservatives who felt censored by social media platforms, and it gained high-profile users including Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo, talk show host Dan Bongino, and Senators Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. Election 2020 winners: pizza delivery, headache hats, and conservative social network Parler.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/1306/takeout.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quick backstory: DoorDash was founded in 2013 by Stanford students, and it’s raised $2.5 billion since, from the likes of SoftBank and other heavy-hitter VCs.  DoorDash divides people more than cilantro  While most business writers agree the economics of running a food delivery company are challenging, some are more confident than others in DoorDash’s sustainability.     The food delivery startup released its IPO prospectus, giving the public a comprehensive view of its business before heading to the public markets in the next few weeks.</description>

  <title>The Pandemic Has Led to a Golf Boom</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYsxZiDtc1wPHmU/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  One golf accessory in particular drew Peloton-esque demand: the humble pushcart. Golf equipment sales were up 42% year-over-year in Q3, and in May, golf bag accessories were the No. 1 trending retail category on Google.   Golf’s sudden appeal has benefited the business side of the game, too.   Will the good times last?   We’re in the middle of a golf boom In September, 25.5% more golf rounds were played than last year, which capped off a wildly popular summer for the sport. And golf rose to the occasion: We Are Golf, a coalition of golf organizations, collaborated closely with the federal government and the CDC to draw up guidelines to make the game safer.   Bottom line: As a young golf nerd, my advice to people who want to grow the game is to make it more accessible. And for people who’ve never understood the appeal of golf, watch the final round of The Masters today.</description>

  <title>Next Wave of IPOs Includes DoorDash and Airbnb</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3ohzdUi5U8LBb4GD4s/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Big picture: As bad as this year has been for procuring dumbbells, it's been quite hospitable to companies going public. It would be one of the biggest U.S. IPOs of the year.   Wish is an e-commerce app that sells ridiculously cheap items.</description>

  <title>We Could Get Used to This: Americans Embrace Remote Work, per Exclusive Morning Brew Polling</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/933/home_office.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  A Morning Brew/Harris poll conducted last weekend found that… Two-thirds (67%) of remote workers say their lifestyle has gotten healthier since working from home. About the same amount (38%) say they've been taking time to cook their meals. This year's social distancing mandates have made employees much more familiar with each other's living rooms.</description>

  <title>Powell: Rising U.S. Covid Cases Threaten Economic Recovery</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3114/covid-19_dodger_stadium.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Can a vaccine fix things?   Flattening the curve is made even harder by widespread pandemic fatigue.    "Certainly it's not going to be a pandemic for a lot longer, because I believe the vaccines are going to turn that around," Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week. Yesterday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot asked residents to go virtual this Thanksgiving and only venture out for essential needs. Parts of the economy are steadily recovering, but as a growing number of state and local governments reimpose restrictions on business activity and social life, "people may lose confidence that it is safe to go out," Powell said.</description>

  <title>Sony and Microsoft Take Different Approaches in Their Latest Console War</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/V6Y9IpDepemUB9IWbd/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the launch of the Sony PlayStation 5 today and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X and S on Tuesday, this week marks harmonic convergence of the console giants all over again—an endless cycle of hyped hardware releases that occurs every eight-ish years. Sony continues to be the hardware leader for die-hard gamers. P.S. Neither Sony nor Microsoft is expected to sell the most consoles this holiday season. A new offering called “All Access” lets gamers pay for the new Xbox in monthly installments, and—here’s the kicker—also signs them up for Xbox’s Netflix-like Game Pass Ultimate gaming subscription service.</description>
