Imagine this: After ordering a Mexican Pizza and a Baja Blast on your phone, you drive up to a screen at the front of one of four drive-thru lanes, scan a QR code, and have your order descend from the restaurant overhead through a tubular contraption. Franchisee Border Foods observed that drive-thru orders at its 230 locations jumped from up to 70% of total sales before Covid-19 to over 90% now. —JW Border Foods CEO Lee Engler told Axios, “We saw a lot of behavior change, and we don’t see (the old way) coming back.”</description>

Imagine this: After ordering a Mexican Pizza and a Baja Blast on your phone, you drive up to a screen at the front of one of four drive-thru lanes, scan a QR code, and have your order descend from the restaurant overhead through a tubular contraption. Franchisee Border Foods observed that drive-thru orders at its 230 locations jumped from up to 70% of total sales before Covid-19 to over 90% now. —JW Border Foods CEO Lee Engler told Axios, “We saw a lot of behavior change, and we don't see (the old way) coming back.”</description>

  <title>California court rules bees are legally fish again</title>

The new classification protects bees—and other insects—under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), and is the culmination of a four-year legal tussle between environmentalists and agriculture groups that has major consequences for farmers in the state. In 2020, a Sacramento County Superior Court sided with the ag groups and reversed the 2018 ruling. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeIn a ruling ripe for a Jay Leno monologue, a California court said last week that bees are legally fish. The court even ruled that anything without a backbone qualifies as fish: jellyfish, insects, and you when your mom guilts you into going on a family vacation. Section 45 of CESA defines fish as “... So in 2018, three environmental groups that were worried about the declining pollinator population in California found a workaround to expand the legal definition of fish to cover four species of endangered bees.</description>

In January, there were just 1,700 jobs advertising a four-day workweek in the US for every 1 million posted. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Bottom line: For all the notable trials and tests of a shorter workweek, finding a job that actually implements one is extremely rare. Trials of lighter work schedules haven’t always been successful for both employees and employers, though: A two-year trial of a six-hour workday in one of Sweden’s largest cities in 2017 left workers happier, healthier, and more productive, but the practice was deemed too expensive due to the new hires needed to fill gaps in time. More than 3,300 workers will participate in the trial, making it the largest test of the four-day workweek. A six-month program that began in the UK on Monday will test the effects of the four-day workweek on thousands of workers across 70 companies. —MK But, if you’re one of the 92% of US employees who are into the idea and don’t want to wait for trial results, you may want to consider moving to France, where a 35-hour workweek cap has been the law since 2000. The results of the trial will be announced sometime in 2023. Several industries will be involved, including banking, health care, marketing, and retail—and through interviews, surveys, and internal productivity measures, researchers will determine if we have all been clocking in on Fridays for our whole adult lives for absolutely no reason.</description>

  <title>"It ain't rocket science": How one FoodToker is making a career as a content creator</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1b91e7c4181dca8717c0ae9c5d148da3d7440235-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Today’s dish is shrimp tempura udon and food content creator H Woo Lee is explaining how to make it from scratch in a behind-the-scenes video. Lee says he and TikToker Sam Way were the first ones to create ASMR cooking videos for TikTok.Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. His videos are relaxing and stylish, concealing the hours of work he puts into creating TikToks for his 1 million followers. No one can taste my food,” Lee said. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. Like a lot of food influencers, Lee isn’t a professional chef. His ultimate goal is to open a restaurant one day so his fans can finally taste his food. “There’s only one way for anyone to differentiate themselves. It’s like a miniature store,” Kar Brulhart, a creator strategist said. “In-person dining, and like being a chef,” Lee said, “that’s my craft.” The 23 year old’s main channel has 92.6 million subscribers and makes at least $3 million per month from YouTube ads alone, per the analytics service SocialBlade. Creators like Lee are ditching the Instagram filters, highly posed pictures, and stylized lattes for content that feels more authentic. Lee compares being a content creator to being an Uber driver: He has the freedom to set his own work schedule, which is what he wanted for himself. These days successful creators are very knowledgeable in their respective fields while coming across as down to earth, but they deliver professional-grade content that is strategically planned and carefully edited, like Lee’s cooking videos. The rise of TikTok stars makes mastery of the app seem like an easy, glamorous, and highly rewarding side hustle, but for most creators, like Lee, that’s simply not true. “There’s so many creators coming into this space now,” Lee explained to Morning Brew. As a full-time creator, Lee makes ASMR-style videos (or to get technical: Autonomous Sensory Meridian) that feature elaborate dishes, like prosciutto arugula pizza and Peking duck, to stand out from his TikTok competitors. But first, he needs to continue producing good food and even better content until Gordon Ramsay comes knocking. It’s a laborious process that, for TikTok, was edited into a tidy 60-second video emphasizing the sounds of his kitchen: the boil of the broth, the sizzle of cooking oil, and Lee’s slurps as he eats his final product. He’s not just cooking intricate meals—he’s also his own planner, cameraman, video editor, and social media manager. His very first viral video had 10.6 millions of views, but even after being a full-time creator for almost a year and half, he still can’t recreate the recipe to that success every time.</description>

  <title>NASA taps two companies to develop lunar spacesuits</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/d0fa9f7bc4d52a6931e12099236c1baf9219e795-3840x2939.jpg?rect=0,189,3840,2560&amp;w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. NASA will test the companies’ suits in 2025, and then decide whether to fund one or both designs. One major reason for the holdup is that the necessary spacesuits won’t be ready on time. It’s been a leading aerospace supplier for decades and has supplied spacesuits to NASA before. Hoping to finally fix its spacesuit production snags, NASA announced this week that it awarded contracts to two teams led by private companies, Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace, to make its suits. NASA’s outsourcing is a tacit admission that its own work developing lunar suits in-house for 15 years has been too costly and time-consuming: As of August 2021, NASA’s spacesuit production schedule has suffered more than 20 months of delays. Construction of the rocket and the lunar lander have been set back by Covid-19 supply and labor challenges, as well as a legal scuffle between NASA and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin after NASA chose Elon Musk’s SpaceX to build the lander. In the end, the whole endeavor was such a slog that NASA finally decided to bring in Axiom Space and Collins Aerospace to help outfit its astronauts. Meanwhile, newcomer Axiom Space was founded in 2016 with the goal of building the first private space station. So, constructing a spacesuit is a Sisyphean task to start with, and NASA faced major hurdles trying to produce them in-house:1. Last year, NASA only received 77% of the funding it requested for part of the lunar program, resulting in a $69 million budget shortfall for suit development and a delay of at least three months. Looking ahead…even if NASA astronauts get the right gear to go to the moon in time, the lunar mission has to overcome several other major obstacles. *sigh*—JW What’s the holdup, exactly?</description>

But it doesn’t conclusively prove that coffee itself is the panacea:Dr. Christina Wee, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and the deputy editor of the journal, told the NYT that other characteristics of coffee drinkers could be contributing to their lower mortality rate, such as diet and exercise. The researchers, who studied 171,000 people in the UK over a seven-year period, found that coffee drinkers were 30% less likely to die during the study period than the coffee-less.</description>

On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia has increased its territorial control to 20%. Zelensky said this week that 60–100 Ukrainian soldiers are dying every day in the conflict, in addition to the tens of thousands of civilians who have been killed since Feb. 24, per Ukrainian estimates. But, despite failing in its initial aims to topple the Ukrainian government, Russia appears set on defending the territory it has already seized. —JW So where do we stand? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeYesterday marked 100 days since Russia invaded Ukraine in a brazen move that has shaken up the post-Cold War geopolitical order, caused economic hardships all over the globe, and displaced millions of people from their homes.</description>

While some leading CEOs are sounding the alarm on a recession, the actual economic data isn’t saying the same thing.
