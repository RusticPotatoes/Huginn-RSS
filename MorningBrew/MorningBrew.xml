  <title>A Rough Timeline of Covid-19 Immunization in the U.S.</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2921/vaccine_clock.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;January 31, 2021: About 50 million Americans could be vaccinated by now, and, grouped in with those who've recovered from Covid-19, over 30% of the population would be immune, per the dean of Brown's public health school, Ashish Jha. February/March: At 30%–40% immunity, according to Jha, the spread will become "meaningfully slower" and infections won't be "self-sustaining."  </description>

  <title>Vaccination in the Workplace: Employers Advised to "Strongly Encourage"</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3219/vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Labor and employment attorney Michael Roche told Business Insider that the safest legal tack is for companies to "strongly encourage employees to get vaccinated." But can employers legally require their workers to get vaccines?  </description>

  <title>Americans Are Divided Over The Covid-19 Vaccine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/s3Klt17UqDYyI/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establishing public trust in these vaccines will be the next major challenge for health officials. That's down from a peak of 50% in September, but remains a concerning number for public health officials who want to get Covid-19 under control.  </description>

  <title>WHO Covax Initiative Seeks Equitable Access to Covid Vaccines</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3150/covid-19_vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far, Covax has secured 700 million doses and $2 billion in funding. The goal is to raise $5 billion and provide 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.   Big picture: The Duke Global Health Institute thinks it'll take until 2024 for vaccines to reach the entire population.  The Duke Global Health Institute estimates 9.6 billion doses are already reserved by individual countries, without any vaccines having reached the market yet.</description>

  <title>Who Gets a Vaccine First?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/eoK5GIUKwf0tO/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The U.S.' ~20 million healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and support staff, will likely be top priority. #3: Not everyone will get a vaccine.     Who's first? But in 2009, researchers published a study suggesting a focus on vaccinating the biggest spreaders—in the case of swine flu, children ages 5–19—to protect everyone else. Reality check: There won't be enough Covid-19 vaccines for everyone for a while. In the last decade, the U.S. has never vaccinated more than half of adults for the flu, and vaccination rates for Black, Latinx, and high-risk adults trend lower. Other factors to consider #1: Different vaccines have different logistical challenges and health considerations, which could affect who gets what when.</description>

  <title>McKesson Will Be the Central Distributor of Covid-19 Vaccines</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3227/former_mckesson_chairman.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The company will not make decisions on where to send the vaccines, however.   Put me in, coach Through Operation Warp Speed, the government has made McKesson the central distributor of Covid-19 vaccines (outside of Pfizer-BioNTech’s, which needs to live in sub-Arctic temps).     Because of McKesson’s expertise in schlepping life-saving material, the country has tapped it for similar programs before. It’s a lucrative business.</description>
