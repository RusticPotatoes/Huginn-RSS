  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/1xo9COytfPE9chS05b/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Pentagon is replacing JEDI with the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC) project and opening up the contract to multiple potential vendors including Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, and anyone else that can prove they’ve got the cloud computing chops to give the Defense Department an IT makeover. Cancel culture strikes again: The Pentagon said yesterday it’s scrapping its $10 billion JEDI cloud-computing contract with Microsoft and replacing it with another one that will require multiple vendors.</description>

  <title>The Next Disruption in Finance Is Here (Yep, It Involves Crypto)</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5670%2Fcrypto_future.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One Small Step for Trading, One Big Step for the Future of FinanceWell, it’s not that simple.  There’s more stuff going on there, but at a technical level, this means it’s a whole lot faster and cheaper to trade assets.  When people make trades on the blockchain, there are no intermediaries in sight—no brokers placing orders, no one rubber-stamping the trade in sight. A gradual, but still seismic, shift is taking place in the financial sector—aka the money biz.  All that takes time; up to two days for just one trade.  Version 2.0: Nothing Between You and Money That’s the normal-person way to describe our topic—disintermediation, or when financial institutions are scrubbed from trading like the videos of last Thursday’s karaoke night from your phone. The banks make money, you make money, other people get loans, everybody wins.</description>

SpaceBezos’s interest in space dates back to his teenage days, when the high school valedictorian told the Miami Herald he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit.”  Fast forward to 2000, when Bezos founded his rocket company Blue Origin two years before Elon Musk would start SpaceX.  </description>

  <title>What's Next for Jeff Bezos? </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5668%2Famazon_unveils_its_first.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PhilanthropyBezos has pledged $10 billion to climate-focused initiatives through the Bezos Earth Fund and gave $2 billion to increase access to education and address homelessness through the Bezos Day One Fund. SpaceBezos’s interest in space dates back to his teenaged days, when the high school valedictorian told the Miami Herald he wanted to “build space hotels, amusement parks, and colonies for 2 million or 3 million people who would be in orbit.”  Fast forward to 2000, when Bezos founded his rocket company Blue Origin two years before Elon Musk would start SpaceX.  </description>

  <title>Companies Offer Lucrative Incentives to Lure Workers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3ofSB3ihsBOceBlXhe/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Still, while incentives have become more popular they're only advertised in 4.2% of total job postings on Indeed. Plus, a bonus is a one-time commitment rather than an ongoing cost—such as a salary bump or additional PTO.</description>

  <title>Help Definitely Wanted: The Restaurant Industry Faces A Labor Crunch</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5662%2Fmcdonald_s_sign_advertising_job_openings.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The restaurant business, inherently and pre-Covid, was a toxic workplace," North Carolina restaurant owner Patrick Whalen told CNN. But many former restaurant workers also found more stable jobs in other industries and didn’t look back.  After surveying over 2,800 food service workers, UC Berkeley Food Labor Research Center said the top three reasons that they’d leave their jobs are low wages and tips, lingering Covid-19 fears, and concerns of hostility from customers.  Where did they go?</description>

  <title>Exclusive: What’s the Job Market for College Students Like This Summer?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F979%2Fcollege_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In a Morning Brew + Generation Lab poll, we asked 500 college students about their work plans for this summer and how they're feeling about it. After the unemployment rate for younger workers shot up to 32% last summer, the jobless rate for teens dropped to 9.6% this May, the lowest it's been since 1953, and stayed pretty steady in June at 9.9%.</description>

  <title>Diving into the Great Resignation and What It Means for American Workers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5648%2Fpeggy_quitting_on_mad_men.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the main reason employees are quitting their jobs en masse, Harvard economics professor Jason Furman argues, is simpler: There are a record number of job openings in the US right now (9.3 million), and in any economy where lots of jobs are available, people leave their existing roles for greener pastures. A bunch of your coworkers are going to quit their jobs over the next few months—if you don’t leave before then.  In what’s been dubbed the “Great Resignation,” 4 million people, or 2.7% of US workers, quit their jobs in April. If they’re not pampered, they’re skedaddling.</description>

This was fascinating: 31% of students said their biggest concern when going to work this summer was understaffing at their employers, beating out worries over health and safety and working remotely. Most of the students having an easier time finding summer work are white.</description>

If you think an investment will return more than your highest interest rate, you might want to start investing some money. Say your only debt is a student loan at 5% interest. If you think an investment will return more than 5% this year, investing might be a good shout. Should college grads start investing before paying off all student loans?  </description>

  <title>Five Fast Firework Facts for the Fourth</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1603%2Ffireworks.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Not helping: 90% of US fireworks are made in China, so logjams at ports over there mean a reduction or delay in getting supply over here. Massachusetts is the only state with a total ban on the sale of consumer fireworks. Thanks, Ben Affleck. 5.</description>

  <title>US Economy Adds 850,000 Jobs in June in Bullish Sign for Labor Market</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lnMsxRxL4RCzdzTRHu/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US economy added 850,000 jobs in June, marking the biggest monthly gain in almost a year and topping expectations. The 850,000 headline number represents a big improvement from May’s jobs report (+583,000 jobs) and April’s (+269,000). Economists hope that the increase in job seekers in June is a sign the labor crunch could smooth out by fall. Challenges remain, of course.</description>
