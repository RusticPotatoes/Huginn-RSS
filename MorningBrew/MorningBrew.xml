  <title>Morning Brew Readers Share Their Quarantine Dating Stories</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/x28cIQSn19Tbi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some made us laugh, some made us cry, and others made us go, “Hmm, didn’t know masks could be used for that.” And because we just met, neither one of us wanted to end the date because we had to pee. To spice things up I said my favorite drink was Mountain Dew... “Did a virtual date for the first time. The call ended about 5 minutes later when I told her I can't date a liar.” she didn't bat an eye and proceeded to tell me she doesn't really drink soda. For more pandemic dating stories, check out the Social Distance Project.</description>

  <title>Swedish King Says His Country "Failed" Pandemic Response</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3459/king_carl_xvi_gustaf.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf said his country "failed" its pandemic response.   Refresher: While other countries enacted strict lockdowns when the pandemic began, Sweden gambled on an open economy and voluntary guidelines, with the goal of eventually reaching herd immunity.   If it's approved, Swedish healthcare workers get dibs around Christmas.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3457/coinbase_ipo.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, crypto exchange Coinbase filed paperwork with the SEC to go public.   There are a couple major unknowns  Coinbase hasn’t announced 1) which exchange it will list on or 2) how the IPO will be structured.   This is really a story about crypto's glow-up  Cryptocurrencies were once the Gunther of the financial world because of their volatility and murky-at-best legal status.      Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is up over 200% on the year.</description>

  <title>Japanese Appliance Startup Pops 88% in Public Market Debut</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3449/balmuda_toaster.jpeg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bottom line: There wasn't a market for high-end toasters until Balmuda showed what was possible. It comes with a little teaspoon of water, which helps seal in moisture. That sexy little oven above will set you back $224, and Balmuda’s “The Gohan” rice cooker costs $400.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6wrpEqt4VpwonyNi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Massachusetts securities regulators filed a complaint against the popular stock trading platform Robinhood for prioritizing “its revenue over the best interest of its customers,” according to documents reviewed by the WSJ.     Robinhood’s easy-to-navigate platform has attracted over 13 million insanely active traders.</description>

  <title>U.S. Labels Vietnam, Switzerland Currency Manipulators</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lptjRBxFKCJmFoibP3/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury labeled the European country and Vietnam currency manipulators.   Why it matters: Labeling countries as currency manipulators is rarer than a Federer two-handed backhand, and it reflects the tougher trade stance taken by the Trump administration toward both allies and rivals.   What is currency manipulation?</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriffhhxhmuQP2Xgk/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The suit claims that Google is the Joey Chestnut to the digital advertising industry's plate of hot dogs.   Yesterday, a group of state attorneys general led by Texas said they're taking legal action against Google for, you guessed it, engaging in anticompetitive practices.   Zoom out: If this feels like déjà sue, you’d be correct.</description>
