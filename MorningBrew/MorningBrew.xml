  <title>House Democrats Propose $2.9 Trillion in Tax Increases</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7399%2Ftax_hike.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This tax proposal is seen as an olive branch to moderate Democrats who don’t want to play the villain to business. On the spicy scale, this plan is mildWhile it reverses many of the Republican tax cuts for 2018, the plan stops short of the ambitious tax hikes President Biden first proposed. Americans who earn more than $435,000 per year would see their top tax rate increase from 37% to 39.6%. House Democrats are all of us before wedding season as they scramble to cover the bill for their pricey $3.5 trillion budget proposal. – MM</description>

  <title>The Future Of Business Travel? The Experts at Morning Brew &amp; Hilton—And You—Weigh In</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7400%2Fbusiness_travel.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taking the Work Out of Work TravelThe infusion of biz travel with leisure activities—say it with us, bleisure—was popular pre-pandemic, but may become more of the norm as travelers make the most of these moments to work from virtually anywhere. * BTW: If you are not already a Hilton Honors member, it’s free to join, and new members can earn up to 5,000 Bonus Points through the end of the year. And there’s a very, very good chance it’ll have a lasting impact on what business travel looks like for years to come. With 48% of readers saying that loyalty program points and rewards were things they most looked forward to when traveling, it’s clear that perks will have even extra oomph as biz travel resumes.   Travel has its perks. New cardmembers can earn up to 180,000 Bonus Points*—equivalent to 4 FREE nights at more than 4,600 Hilton hotels worldwide—and get Hilton Honors Gold Status (hello complimentary room upgrades) AND earn Points at places like U.S. supermarkets, gas stations and restaurants. Turns out, Morning Brew readers miss business travel too. Paired with insights from Hilton’s Global Head of Marketing &amp; Loyalty Mark Weinstein, and our resident travel expert, Elyssa, we uncovered what you miss most about business travel (hello, alone time) —and what it could mean for the future. But the pandemic has pushed us to reconsider its purpose and pushed hotels like Hilton to reconsider their role in travelers’ lives, placing even more importance on meeting both their emotional and functional needs and desires, according to Weinstein. Hilton for example offered hotel rooms for guests to increase efficiency in their workday, and several hotels ran offers to allow business professionals to stay, work and play for an extended period of time. To appeal to new WFH travelers, hotels adapted by offering ideal working spaces and access to local coworking spots. With video calls being our M.O. for so long, business travel moving forward may be viewed less as a chore and more like a special treat.</description>

  <title>Biden Expands Production of At-Home Covid Tests, Where the US Is Behind</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7372%2Fabbot_s_at-home_covid_test.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zoom out: Michael Mina, a Harvard epidemiologist who’s been arguing for more at-home tests since last year, said Biden’s plan was a “good start,” but it still represents less than one test per American over the course of a year.  Even India, which has fewer resources than the US, is selling rapid tests for $3.50.  Problem is, in the US over-the-counter rapid tests are expensive and scarce.</description>

  <title>Biden Expands Production of At-Home Covid Tests, Where the US Is Behind</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7372%2Fabbot_s_at-home_covid_test.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zoom out: Michael Mina, a Harvard epidemiologist who’s been arguing for more at-home tests since last year, said Biden’s plan was a “good start,” but by the numbers it still represents less than one test per American over the course of a year.  Even India, which has fewer resources than the US, is selling rapid tests for $3.50.  Problem is, in the US over-the-counter rapid tests are expensive and scarce.</description>

  <title>Epic Games Wins Lawsuit Against Apple</title>

The backstory: Last summer, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney martyred his top-earning game Fortnite by encouraging users to make in-game purchases (hamburger helmets, demogorgon skins) outside of Apple’s payment systems in protest of the steep commission Apple charges developers in its App Store.</description>

  <title>How is Covid Affecting Campus Life?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7309%2Fwoman_walks_on_a_college_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;58% of college students believe that their school should require vaccinations. Bella Mortel, a University of Texas at Austin Junior, said, “Seeing students and professors back on campus on the first day of school this year reminded me of how critical the in-person experience is! Only 28% of students had complete trust that their schools would keep them safe from Covid, while 47% of students said, “Yes, sort of.” Another ID to lose. Ben Klein, who started his third year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, “I feel more comfortable that we have to wear masks and social distance during in-person classes, but at the end of the day if our area gets swamped with Delta, Mu, or some other variant, I think cases are inescapable. In a Morning Brew + Generation Lab poll, we asked 524 college students across the US about their experiences back on campus. Students definitely, maybe trust their school.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with...Master Sommelier Ian Cauble</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7288%2Fian_cauble.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But most people don't have that bottle of wine you found on that shelf in that specific wine shop. With just a 5% pass rate, the top wine test has snarled the dreams of all but 267 people who are able to call themselves a true Master. In 2012, Ian Cauble passed the wine world’s version of astronaut training to become one of only a few Master Sommeliers in the world. Why is wine the go-to dinner party gift? Most people start by working in restaurants for a very long time—a lot of them for more than 10 years by the time they pass the Master Sommelier exam. It’s a very easy gift and there's usually a great story behind it. I would say most wine is not designed to age.</description>

  <title>Your 2021–2022 NFL Season Preview </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/C0D9AFGOus9TIRA6CF/giphy-downsized-large.gif?cid=ecf05e47o9fiqx2hu7lucilk7fyn6cip6ldblftum4720n2k&amp;rid=giphy-downsized-large.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new NFL season kicks off with a full slate of games today. During the offseason, the NFL struck deals with seven sportsbook operators, which, among other things, allows them to buy commercial spots during NFL games for the first time ever. This season, Amazon Prime Video will share the rights with NFL Network and Fox for Thursday Night Football (TNF), but come 2022 you’ll be all Andy Jassy’s: Amazon will be the exclusive “broadcaster” for TNF for the next 10 years. More streamingAs part of the NFL’s new gargantuan media rights deal reportedly worth over $100 billion, streaming will play a bigger role. Gambling companies will make more money, football players will make more money, and the NFL itself certainly stands to gain from an extra slot for advertising, ticket sales, merchandise, and more.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Building Strong Virtual Relationships</title>

Any advice/tips on how to build healthy professional relationships with new teammates? Something I’m doing with my current team is a rotating brown bag, whereby we use part of our weekly meeting for a team member to teach us something new. —Brandon from MinneapolisAs someone who relies on poor lighting in order to be the best-looking person on my video calls, I’m probably not the best source of advice on this one.
