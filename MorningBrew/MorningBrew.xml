  <title>Icebreakers with... Cameo CEO Steven Galanis</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4838%2Fsteven_galanis.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I collect a lot now—this even predates Cameo and I think it's one of the reasons I got into it. You started Cameo while still working at LinkedIn. What was the "aha" moment when you knew you were ready to go full-time?  I think people can blow up on Cameo and become sensations there. My brain chemistry changed that day, and I just knew I had to go and pursue this. So I would probably love to be one of the 300 Spartans that fought. I don't think we can take you from zero to one, but I think we could take you from one to 10. If you could live in the setting of any book or movie, what would it be? I grew up as a hockey player.  And the answer was no.</description>

  <title>Italian Man Skips Work for 15 Years, Still Gets Paid</title>

  <title>The $0 Budget Movie That Topped the Pandemic Box Office</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3303%2Ftv_movie_theater.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  No one attended the movie besides Nilsson and Tabach, but after three screenings of Unsubscribe, they managed to pay enough money to themselves for the movie to top the box office. Perhaps no image captures the preposterousness of the last year for movie theaters than the box office chart for June 10, 2020.  One thing's for sure: As charming a story as it is, if a movie like Unsubscribe tops the box office again something will have gone very, very wrong. Hollywood bulls say to look at the recent box office success of Godzilla vs.   Box Office Mojo On that day, a Wednesday, a movie called Unsubscribe topped the US charts with $25,488 in gross earnings, beating out several other movies that were shown at drive-ins. if you had one shot...</description>

Yes, I know that you reaaally want to land a job.   I'm a Black woman and entrepreneur, but given the past year's difficulties, I'm contemplating going back to the workforce. I switch my hairstyle probably every two months and absolutely no one makes weird comments or makes it a point of discussion at the beginning of Zoom meetings.</description>

  <title>5 Things to Know About Rideshare Driver Taxes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4824%2Fuber_driver.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deduction just for existingNow that we’ve covered how Uber and Lyft drivers can lower tax bills by deducting business expenses, it’s time to talk about the other ways you can keep trimming. Tyler, 31, a Florida-based rideshare driver since 2015 and writer for The Rideshare Guy, told the Brew that even as a part-time gig worker, the actual expense method has “never even come close” to the more sizable standard mileage rate deduction. They’re also required to send a copy to the IRS, so tax authorities know how much you earned before you even file your taxes. It’s always tax season in the gig economyAn underrated perk of being a W-2 employee: Your employer is required to withhold a portion of each paycheck for federal, state, and payroll taxes. “If your car starts to take more repairs than you're making, and you're going to continue to drive for rideshare, then it might be time to get a new car,” he said. The IRS helps you cover the cost of gas, repairs, and other expenses with a deduction that you can calculate in one of two ways. Here’s the formula:Standard mileage deduction = (Business miles x IRS standard mileage rate) + Unreimbursed parking and tollsIf your mileage tracker says you drove 10,000 miles for Lyft in 2020, you’d qualify for a $5,750 vehicle expense deduction. Two ways to deduct vehicle expensesDriving for Uber does to your car what dairy does to my body: makes it cry for help. Other common deductible rideshare driver expenses are:Vehicle expensesUnreimbursed tolls and feesHand sanitizerFace masksFlashlightsFlaresFloor matsJumper cablesFirst aid kitsAir freshenersWagons for big grocery deliveriesWater bottles for ridersMusic subscriptions (like Pandora or Apple Music) for rider enjoymentJaz, 29, is a full-time gig worker who drives for Uber, Uber Eats, Lyft, DoorDash, Postmates, you get the idea, and documents it all on her YouTube channel. With the standard mileage rate, you’re waiving the right to deduct most vehicle expenses independently. These forms of income are still taxable, with or without the tax document. Completes 200 rides or deliveriesDrivers who don’t reach the 1099-K minimums might be asking: How do I file my taxes without a tax form?</description>

  <title>Tesla Struggles with More Upsets in China This Week</title>

In March, Tesla cars were banned from military complexes in China over fears their cameras would be used to spy on the government.</description>

  <title>Biden Will Propose Nearly Doubling Capital Gains Tax</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4828%2Fdiamond_hands.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;President Biden will soon propose nearly doubling the capital gains tax for wealthy people to 39.6%, according to Bloomberg.  To pay for the first plan, which includes spending on bridges and broadband, Biden wants to hike taxes on corporations. Critics of the current capital gains system say, "So you're telling me this rich investor is paying less in taxes on their stock sales than a middle-class worker pays on their income? To pay for his second proposal, which includes spending on childcare and paid leave for workers, he wants to hike taxes on wealthy investors.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3733%2Ftesla_with_wheel_lock.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But the company's cavalier attitude and inability to keep up with auto repairs as sales grow rapidly have rubbed some Chinese regulators the wrong way. In March, Tesla cars were banned from military complexes in China over fears their cameras would be used to spy on the government.</description>

  <title>Supreme Court Limits FTC's Ability to Recoup Ill-Gotten Gains</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F858%2Fsupreme_court.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Justices said the FTC needs to ask Congress to grant those powers back, which acting FTC Chair Rebecca Slaughter did earlier this week.  For decades, the FTC has used a provision called Section 13(b) to recoup billions of dollars and (at times) pay back consumers.</description>

  <title>Biden Will Propose Nearly Doubling Capital Gains Tax</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4828%2Fdiamond_hands.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;President Biden will soon propose nearly doubling the capital gains tax for wealthy people to 39.6%, according to Bloomberg.  To pay for the first plan, which includes spending on bridges and broadband, Biden wants to hike taxes on corporations. Critics of the current capital gains system say, "So you're telling me this rich investor is paying less in taxes on their stock sales than a middle-class worker pays on her income? To pay for his second proposal, which includes spending on childcare and paid leave for workers, he wants to hike taxes on wealthy investors.</description>

  <title>NFTs, Intellectual Property, and What It Really Means to Own a Digital Kitty</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F4HkhMcckoSwdDBzho9%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bluebox is a new NFT platform that automatically copyrights an artist’s song and then divides that into 100 NFTs that include 1% of the song’s copyright. Some platforms set terms for buyers’ intellectual property rights because the platforms themselves create and mint the NFTs. But on platforms like OpenSea and Nifty Gateway, where creators can mint NFTs of their own works…Artists aren’t so willing to give away their IP Giphy Surprise, surprise: There were no copyrights attached to the sales of multimillion-dollar music NFTs by 3LAU, Steve Aoki, Kings of Leon, and Grimes. And Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda, who released a new song as an NFT in April, told Input magazine, “There’s nobody who’s serious about NFTs who really humors the idea that what you’re selling is the copyright or the master.”  An NFT without the copyright is like one of the purses, not Mickey Mouse himself.  For creators like Shinoda, that’s because selling the copyrights to his work would mean ceding all future profits that work could generate. An NFT can include IP, but it doesn’t have to.  Copyright permissions for NFTs can be set by the “minter” (the person who turns a creative asset into an NFT), or they can be set by “walled garden” platforms that do all the minting themselves. Whether the works of art represented by these blockchain-backed digital tokens are protected by copyright law. Picture this: NFTs and intellectual property (IP) are like the opposite sides of a Venn diagram. A copyright allows its owner to use a work in whichever way they choose, and to profit off of its use. The case gets more complicated than that, but it’s significant here because it's the first high-profile intellectual property squabble in the NFT space.</description>
