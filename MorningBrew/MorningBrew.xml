  <title>Payroll to the People</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5903%2Fpaycom.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Paycom has created Beti, which can further streamline the payroll process by empowering employees to do their own payroll.  And not to get all “ACT NOW” on you, but if you’re waiting until employees ask for employee-driven payroll, it’s already too late. So why keep doing payroll the less-efficient way? Free of FrustrationBy giving employees the tools they need to take control of their payroll processes, you give them the power to prevent frustrating or time-consuming follow-ups if their paycheck is wrong. But now, the thought of a company or brand not having an app seems even more foreign.</description>

Wear what you want. What do I know about running a company? Is there an item of clothing or accessory that you think everyone should have in their closet? I don't think in my entire career there's ever been a time where I was afraid to be vulnerable with my own struggles. But what I really think is that you can wear what you want and get what you want if you understand how style can help you control the narrative of yourself. we just want to talk).  But we've stopped looking for expertise, and we are looking for shared experience. I am. Are you a breakfast person? Both of them have sweet matcha that's not too sweet.</description>

  <title>The Olympics May Have Been Rescheduled, But The 2020 Logo Doesn’t Know That</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5899%2Fpeople_wearing_masks.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the fact that it is very much the year 2021, all Olympic marketing materials, from the TV ads to the gold medals, are stamped with the “Tokyo 2020” logo. One can only imagine the underground market that would have erupted for “Tokyo 2020” merch. Like your old high school friend who constantly brings up his state football championship, the Tokyo Olympics are living in the past. A decision to keep the original branding was made last March, when Japan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Summer games for the first time in history.  The real reason Tokyo 2020 didn’t become Tokyo 2021 is because a change would have been supremely expensive.</description>

  <title>California Sues Gaming Company Activision Blizzard</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5879%2Factivision.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;California legislators sued video game developer Activision Blizzard yesterday, citing its “pervasive ‘frat boy’ culture” and mistreatment of women employees. The suit details that one female employee died by suicide on a corporate trip after nude photos were leaked and shared among male colleagues who had previously harassed her. Bottom line: The lawsuit against Activision Blizzard shows that the #MeToo movement is still reaching its crescendo in the video game industry.  Ubisoft (Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry) was accused of rampant sexism and racism last summer. Denial on all fronts. Activision’s response?</description>

  <title>France Starts Mandating Vaccination for Entry to Cultural Venues</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5861%2Fno_vaccine_no_entry.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The US federal government hasn’t introduced any vaccine requirements for businesses, and it likely won’t take any steps until the FDA grants full approval to at least one of the shots. The vaccine strategy has resulted in two things:It has angered a lot of people: More than 100,000 protestors hit the streets last weekend, saying the vaccine rules infringed on their rights.   Bottom line: From $1 million lotteries to calling in Olivia Rodrigo for a PSA, US officials have offered loads of carrots to push the vaccine-hesitant to get their shots.</description>

  <title>So the Billionaires Went to Space. Now What?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5846%2Fjeff_bezos_blue_origin_n.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its big report on the space industry, Morgan Stanley identified the 10 drivers of a space economy that could grow to $1 trillion by 2040. Reality check: While space tourism news has gotten the recent buzz, it’s just a small slice of the overall space market, which is currently dominated by SpaceX. After he landed yesterday, Bezos said sales for private seats on Blue Origin flights (two more of which are planned for this year) are already approaching $100 million. Now that Bezos and Richard Branson have both completed their flights, what’s next for the space tourism industry?</description>
