  <title>Icebreakers With...Andrew Ross Sorkin</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4914%2Fandrew_ross_sorkin.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I work 80+ hours a week and I've always done it because I love it.  What is the dumbest thing you made your parents buy for you as a kid? I convinced my father, based on my track record of making money trading cards, to invest in a case of Fleer Ultra baseball cards. It isn't that he is intimidating as a person; it is that he is so smart and deep on so many different topics. So I'm going to try to figure out how to do a lot more of my work with my family within reach and to be more strategic about travel, work dinners, etc.  You can only do one: writing for the New York Times, TV anchoring, or producing (co-creating Billions for Showtime, developing a GameStop film for HBO). We still have the cards if anyone wants to buy them.</description>

  <title>Hot Rod Charlie and His Five Best Human Friends Have Big Kentucky Derby Dreams</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4917%2Fhot_rod_charlie.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, as the friends traveled the country over the last year to watch Chuck run and also perhaps enjoy a few beers, they never expected the horse to end up qualifying for the most elite horse race in the world. After their first two horses didn’t work out, they found Hot Rod Charlie, the horse that currently has the fourth-best odds to win the Kentucky Derby this Saturday. Baby Chuck via Patrick O'Neill The people’s horseO’Neill said that the Boat Racing crew has received a lot of support from family and friends, but also from people they’ve never met. In every good horse movie—Seabiscuit, Hidalgo, Racing Stripes—there’s a brooding protagonist who, throughout everything, believes their horse can win. He’d seen the way betting on horse racing had driven wedges between families and friends in the past, even his own family at times. To even be considered for the big day, the horse has to be three years old, which means every horse running this year’s race was one of the 19,664 registered Thoroughbreds born in 2018. Patrick O’Neill grew up watching horse races and has always loved the sport. The crew, most of whom went into finance after graduating, approached wiggling into the high-dollar sport sort of like a hedge fund, pooling their money to own 25% of Chuck (O’Neill said we could call the horse by his nickname because we’re cool).</description>

Zoom out: While the situation in the US is highly encouraging, in India it’s only getting worse.  Now, the US economy is less than 1% off its pre-Covid peak. Full reopenings are coming. Yesterday, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will “fully reopen” for business July 1, just 14 months after the city was paralyzed by an initial Covid-19 wave. Halfway through earnings season, S&amp;P 500 companies have reported the strongest earnings growth in more than a decade. Covid cases are falling.</description>

Biden’s plan includes a) bumping up the top income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% b) nearly doubling the capital gains tax for wealthy investors, and c) giving more resources to the IRS to crack down on tax avoiders. Here’s a quick review of the other two bills: The American Rescue Plan: This was the $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill Congress passed in March.</description>
