  <title>What's the Hype Around Air Fryers?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4440%2Fair_fryer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A few years later, van der Weij licensed the tech to Philips, which debuted the first modern air fryer at a consumer electronics show in Berlin in 2010.  But what is an air fryer? But here’s where the genius of van der Weij comes in: Air fryers get your food nice and crispy without the oil bath.

  <title>Supply Chains Need a Factory Reset </title>

  <title>SPACs Post Record Q1 and Exceed 2020 Dealmaking Total</title>

It's advised 32 SPACs in Q1 for $9.2 billion in proceeds, according to Refinitiv data. Only Citigroup's got it beat with 56 SPAC IPOs for $10.5 billion. And the SEC recently warned investors to treat celebrities' SPACs with the same skepticism as their Proactiv commercials.</description>
