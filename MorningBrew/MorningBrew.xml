  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2161%2Fprimary.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Submit your money woes here. If you think an investment will return more than your highest interest rate, you might want to start investing some money. Say your only debt is a student loan at 5% interest. If you think an investment will return more than 5% this year, investing might be a good shout. Should college grads start investing before paying off all student loans?  </description>

  <title>US Economy Adds 850,000 Jobs in June in Bullish Sign for Labor Market</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lnMsxRxL4RCzdzTRHu/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US economy added 850,000 jobs in June, marking the biggest monthly gain in almost a year and topping expectations. The 850,000 headline number represents a big improvement from May’s jobs report (+583,000 jobs) and April’s (+269,000). Economists hope that the increase in job seekers in June is a sign the labor crunch could smooth out by fall. Challenges remain, of course.</description>

  <title>Origin Stories: July Fourth’s Favorite Companies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5659%2F2018_nathan_s_famous_hot_dog_eating_contest.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nathan’s Hot DogsYes, a guy named Nathan did actually start this company. Old Navy became the first clothing company to reach $1 billion in sales in its first four years of business. What’s up with the matching Old Navy shirts in every single one of our family pics? In 2012, Solo was acquired by Dart Container for $1 billion, and according to the company’s website, fans post 400,000+ photos with the iconic red cup every year.  Red Solo cupIt’s the early 1930s in Chicago, and disposable cups are all the rage after the city council banned the use of germy “common drinking cups” 20 years before. The contest, where competitors have 10 minutes to inhale as many hot dogs as they can, has aired live on ESPN since 2004. Why is Nathan's the first name you think of when you picture a hot dog? In 1916, Nathan Handwerker began selling hot dogs in New York’s Coney Island for five cents.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How to Address a Pay Gap Issue</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Hey Kate, I recently discovered that I am being paid 25%–33% less than my male colleagues working in the same position with the same level of education and work experience. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021.  If you don’t get a positive response, maybe it’s time to look for an employer that values your talents and experience.

  <title>Icebreakers With...Beeple</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5657%2Fpicture_of_beeple.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's not a part of NFTs.What is the future of NFTs? NFTs will be part of your life, just because they'll be the easiest way to prove that you own things. This WENEW project is one new use case for NFTs. As more use cases come, more people will learn about this technology and see value in it for something that connects to their lives.  It's been really exciting to be a part of something that feels like it's the beginning. It’s still the most expensive NFT ever sold.  The other thing that is tough for people to understand is that one of the main aspects of ownership with many things is being able to restrict access to that thing. They’ll be attached to a bunch of different things that make it easy to prove that you are the one single person that has that thing.  You’ve had quite a year, selling an NFT for $69 million. It’s a super exciting time, and I feel very honored to be a part of that.</description>

The relaxation of rules governing name, image, and likeness (NIL) allows college athletes to sign endorsement deals and make money off their fame for the first time, resulting in a “transcendent day for American sports,” Sports Illustrated writes.</description>

  <title>China's Communist Party Turns 100</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5622%2Fchina_ceremony.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the liberalization of China’s economy, the country has developed a close business relationship with the West—just last week Nike’s CEO said, “Nike is a brand that is of China and for China.”  After the Communists gained power in the 1949 revolution, Mao initiated a series of disastrous economic reforms that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people. Bottom line: At 100 years old, the Communist Party remains a potent global force led by a president who could be the first since Mao to rule until he dies. Its caginess around the origins of Covid-19 has made things worse.</description>

  <title>The Top Five Business Stories of Q2</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5600%2Fimage_of_a_scoreboard_showing_end_of_q2.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Inflation scaries With prices increasing at rates not seen in years, the No. 1 business story of the quarter could only be inflation. The number of companies citing inflation in their earnings calls hit a 10-year high, Chipotle hiked its menu prices, and at one point in April the cheapest rental car on Maui was a Toyota Camry that cost $722 a day. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has argued higher inflation is mostly transitory, while legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones responded, “that one just doesn’t work the way I see the world.” More Americans quit in May than any month on record. Yet lingering health concerns, childcare responsibilities, and generous unemployment payments have kept Americans from returning to the labor force. With the economy reawakening faster than expected, employers are desperate to hire employees to meet demand. Help wanted9.3 million. 2. For example, in Mississippi less than a third of the population is fully vaccinated.</description>

  <title>Facebook Launches Bulletin, Its Subscription Newsletter Service</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/jqU6OtxNhty3DuMz6h/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Bulletin is Facebook’s latest product that chases individual creators; its previous launch was a Clubhouse competitor for live audio content, which Zuck used to announce Bulletin. The other major competitor in the space is Twitter, after it purchased newsletter platform Revue in January.</description>

  <title>SpaceX’s Starlink Internet Service Has 69,420 Users</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/fr0a9Np0PlcJTVevU5/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Musk said Starlink could make up to $30 billion in revenue per year—about 10 times the revenue of the rocket-launching side of SpaceX. Starlink provides internet via a network of over 1,500 satellites orbiting low enough for stargazers to spot them overhead.    But like cheap printers with expensive ink, Starlink hopes to recoup initial costs later on. 69,420, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said yesterday.</description>

  <title>US Home Price Growth Hits a Record High in April</title>

Home prices in cities like Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle are all up more than 20% year over year. “People are kind of burnt out.” Sounds pretty bubbly, right? Another buyer in Austin, TX, bought two houses from the same seller so he could get the one he really wanted.</description>

  <title>United Makes Big Bet on the Future of Air Travel</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5595%2Fcatalogue_of_plane.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yes, we mean actual business travel “Everything we see every week makes us even more certain that business travel and international travel are ultimately going to come back,” United CEO Scott Kirby said. Fast forward to yesterday, and United Airlines just placed its largest plane order ever and the biggest of any airline in a decade. One does not simply order 270 state-of-the-art planes worth more than $30 billion and then leave them unused in the hangar.</description>
