Everything about this launch pushes the limits of conventional space flight:Starship is made of stainless steel, which the space industry has typically shunned for its weight. Musk has acknowledged this flight might not go as planned. That could allow it to refuel on Mars, since the planet’s atmosphere contains trace amounts of the gas. Today at 8am ET, a two-and-a-half-hour launch window will open for Starship and the Super Heavy booster it’s mounted on.</description>

  <title>How AI can lower the costs of clinical trials</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/bfaed376e9e46b4c1dd6be5e731bb00b0b8775bd-7346x4900.jpg?rect=0,1,7346,4897&amp;w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. A reason a lot of healthy people choose to join Phase 1 clinical trials is the financial incentive, since you can make thousands of dollars from participating in a trial. AI can make it way easier to identify patients who meet the qualifications for a trial, mainly by sorting through massive troves of data that no human would be able to go through on their own, said Arun Bhatt, an independent clinical research and drug development consultant. One reason AI may not be used as much as it could is a lack of trust, Bhatt said. And therefore, I think clinical trials is one of the very, very last to come into this digital economy,” said Gallaher. We’re not here to weigh in on the likelihood of a future AI robot versus human apocalypse, but one thing we do know is that—when it comes to clinical trials—AI has the potential to do a lot of good. The median compensation for healthy volunteers in phase one clinical trials is $3,070, according to a 2021 study. Gallaher estimated that 10%-15% of trials use AI for recruitment. Opyl uses AI to identify potential trial participants via social media, Gallaher said. A lot of costs go into the recruitment phase. “Healthcare is one of the last industries to come to digital transformation. Opyl’s AI platform can identify that person as a potential participant for a clinical trial testing a new diabetes treatment. There are costs for marketing, so participants know there’s a trial to join. “Right now, the world can’t afford the medicines and the devices that are coming out,” said Michelle Gallaher, CEO of Opyl, which created an AI platform that’s used for trial recruitment. AI can quickly pinpoint who’s eligible for a trial, said Bhatt. Clinical trials are extremely expensive—they cost, on average, $700 million to $1 billion, according to Stefan Harrer, chief innovation officer at the Digital Health Cooperative Research Centre, an Australian investment fund and incubator for the digital health industry. In practice, not a lot of clinical trials are actually using AI yet, at least not for recruitment.</description>

According to a report released by the Recording Industry Association of America on Wednesday, Latin music revenue surged 24% last year to hit a record high of $1.1 billion in the US. Big picture: With Daddy Yankee now retired from the music scene, Bad Bunny and a deep bench of emerging Latin artists are conquering the airwaves and reaching audiences Ricky Martin never could, thanks to the advent of streaming services. —NF Here, Bad Bunny is the GOAT: He’s been the most-streamed artist on Spotify globally for three straight years (18.5 billion streams in all). css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeOn Friday, Puerto Rican megastar Bad Bunny closed out the first day of Coachella—an appropriate finale to a landmark week for Latin music.

And when women become the house’s primary income earner, little really changes about how much time either partner spends on chores, Pew found.

Rick Schlesinger, president of business operations for the Brewers, said extending the alcohol cutoff to the eighth inning reflects “the fact that the games are shorter.” Thanks to the implementation of the pitch clock, which regulates time between pitches, the average game time is down 31 minutes, according to the Associated Press.

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. One NPR reporter found that less than 2% of NPR’s website traffic comes from Twitter, which is pretty standard across the industry. And Twitter is not just losing NPR’s content stream: PBS also confirmed yesterday that it had stopped tweeting on April 8 after it too received a “government-funded” label on its main account and has no plans to log back in.
