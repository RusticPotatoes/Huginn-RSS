  <title>Epic Games Wins Lawsuit Against Apple</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7367%2Fepic_games_vs_apple.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game was promptly booted from the App Store, and Epic launched its revolution with a 1984-style video and a lawsuit against Apple, which culminated in a high-profile trial featuring testimony from Apple CEO Tim Cook. The backstory: Last summer, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney martyred his top-earning game Fortnite by encouraging users to make in-game purchases (hamburger helmets, demogorgon skins) outside of Apple’s payment systems in protest of the steep commission Apple charges developers in its App Store.</description>

  <title>How is Covid Affecting Campus Life?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7309%2Fwoman_walks_on_a_college_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;58% of college students believe that their school should require vaccinations. Bella Mortel, a University of Texas at Austin Junior, said, “Seeing students and professors back on campus on the first day of school this year reminded me of how critical the in-person experience is! Only 28% of students had complete trust that their schools would keep them safe from Covid, while 47% of students said, “Yes, sort of.” Another ID to lose. Ben Klein, who started his third year at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said, “I feel more comfortable that we have to wear masks and social distance during in-person classes, but at the end of the day if our area gets swamped with Delta, Mu, or some other variant, I think cases are inescapable. In a Morning Brew + Generation Lab poll, we asked 524 college students across the US about their experiences back on campus. Students definitely, maybe trust their school.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with...Master Sommelier Ian Cauble</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7288%2Fian_cauble.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But most people don't have that bottle of wine you found on that shelf in that specific wine shop. With just a 5% pass rate, the top wine test has snarled the dreams of all but 267 people who are able to call themselves a true Master. In 2012, Ian Cauble passed the wine world’s version of astronaut training to become one of only a few Master Sommeliers in the world. Why is wine the go-to dinner party gift? Most people start by working in restaurants for a very long time—a lot of them for more than 10 years by the time they pass the Master Sommelier exam. It’s a very easy gift and there's usually a great story behind it. I would say most wine is not designed to age.</description>

  <title>Your 2021–2022 NFL Season Preview </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/C0D9AFGOus9TIRA6CF/giphy-downsized-large.gif?cid=ecf05e47o9fiqx2hu7lucilk7fyn6cip6ldblftum4720n2k&amp;rid=giphy-downsized-large.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new NFL season kicks off with a full slate of games today. During the offseason, the NFL struck deals with seven sportsbook operators, which, among other things, allows them to buy commercial spots during NFL games for the first time ever. This season, Amazon Prime Video will share the rights with NFL Network and Fox for Thursday Night Football (TNF), but come 2022 you’ll be all Andy Jassy’s: Amazon will be the exclusive “broadcaster” for TNF for the next 10 years. More streamingAs part of the NFL’s new gargantuan media rights deal reportedly worth over $100 billion, streaming will play a bigger role. Gambling companies will make more money, football players will make more money, and the NFL itself certainly stands to gain from an extra slot for advertising, ticket sales, merchandise, and more.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Building Strong Virtual Relationships</title>

Any advice/tips on how to build healthy professional relationships with new teammates? Something I’m doing with my current team is a rotating brown bag, whereby we use part of our weekly meeting for a team member to teach us something new. —Brandon from MinneapolisAs someone who relies on poor lighting in order to be the best-looking person on my video calls, I’m probably not the best source of advice on this one. Have a question about work you want to ask Shane?</description>

  <title>Biden’s New Vaccine Mandate Could Affect 80 Million US Workers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ej1Ajh2zU2ER5YiMdD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The president announced yesterday that all businesses with 100 or more workers will need to mandate vaccines or administer weekly tests for employees, potentially affecting 80 million US workers. And Biden’s not just taking aim at the private sector—all federal workers will need to get vaccinated within 75 days or face losing their jobs. Almost 30,000 children were hospitalized with Covid in August, the most ever reported to date, according to government health data. The government has tried everything else to convince more Americans to get vaccinated, and it hasn't worked."</description>

  <title>The SEC Threatens to Sue Coinbase</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7330%2Fcoinbase_court_case.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coinbase contends that Lend doesn’t involve securities and called that assumption “strange.” In this case, the SEC says they’ll sue Coinbase if and when it launches Lend. That’s how Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong described the SEC’s latest crypto crackdown. In a blog post and a nowadays-mandatory Twitter thread, Coinbase executives said they don’t understand what grounds the SEC is suing them on, and that the SEC has refused to loop them in.</description>

  <title>Home, Sweet Futuristic, Home: The Rise of High-Tech Consumer Products</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7315%2Fstarship_technologies.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;) But what’s really important to keep in mind is that whether it’s tech that cleans or tech that drives you to work—it’s all here to make our lives easier. Ultrasonic recognition tech gives you complete control. In terms of recognition of obstacles in the home, for example, AI allows machines to take in complex data and make sense of it on the fly. Compared to just camera-based navigation, LiDAR allows for a level of precision that can help your tech move like it’s actually, truly smart. And while some people are still standing on street corners wondering why they can’t hail a flying taxi, we’re here to talk about the futuristic tech that can be in your home today.  And while this tech can tell a product where they are, it can also tell it where not to go.</description>

Lend would let Coinbase users earn interest by lending digital assets—specifically, a stablecoin called USD Coin—to others. That’s how Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong described the SEC’s latest crypto crackdown. According to Coinbase, the Wall Street regulator has sent the leading crypto exchange a “Wells notice” regarding its upcoming lending product, Lend.</description>

  <title>Your employees' mental health care starts with your own</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/mHwiw1aa0ztS6clQGy/giphy.gif?cid=790b761173866b309d7508c4d9912daf31a6174c564adcbd&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;“Take time off,” Hartless said.  With burnout on the rise, Hartless said it’s essential that companies give workers the ability to create boundaries. Make room beyond Zoom According to July’s Mental Health Index: US Worker Edition, which synthesized random survey results of 500 workers, the risk of generalized anxiety among US workers has risen 94% since July and 98% since the beginning of the pandemic. To combat that sense of unrelenting work, she said it’s important to let workers know that they can switch their cameras off during video calls, and take time off to tend to their own mental health. At Mitel, the company created a “Wellness Village,” crammed with employee resources, such as webinars where workers can vent about their struggles during the pandemic.  Hartless said her company has implored its leaders to “open the door” by addressing mental health; in one example, she recalled an executive who talked about his long battle with mental health for a group of employees. HR’s function as an emotional sounding board for employees has only intensified during the pandemic, despite the fact that HR professionals are also suffering.</description>
