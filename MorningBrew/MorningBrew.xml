  <title>Why are rent prices still so high?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1494930b05846b2adc1919ee52a5916f76df6e06-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Rent growth is 17% higher than 2021 levels, despite beginning to moderate in September, according to Rent. In other words: Rental prices could be cooling off, but the official CPI data doesn’t reflect this. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, introduced a federal bill last October that would strip large investors from snatching up single-family homes for tax incentives. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. If that trend continues, then rent prices might fall in line with real-time inflationary measures. But if BlackRock isn’t totally responsible for stubbornly high rent prices, and neither are Airbnb hosts who drill through tasteful architectural details to hang driftwood signs that read “I’M ON LAKE TIME”... ), one other theory has gained steam in the last few years: Investment firms are scooping up homes and constricting supply. But in 2010, as credit and mortgage markets tightened following the pop of the 2008 housing bubble, more than 75% of growth in the market came from renters with incomes of $75,000 or more, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. For example, month over month rent growth was 0.5% in March, an improvement from the approximately 0.8% monthly increase we saw in late 2022. Since the pandemic began, housing prices have soared. In the March consumer price index report, rents jumped almost 9% from last year, far outpacing the overall inflation rate of 5%. Some point to spiking mortgage rates driving would-be homeowners into the rental market; others to investment firms scooping up units and limiting the available supply. When asked why renters can’t find a studio under two grand, housing experts and economists often point to one thing: not enough supply.</description>

  <title>Ed Sheeran’s copyright infringement trial starts</title>

The case dates back to 2017, when the family of Ed Townsend—Gaye’s co-writer on “Let’s Get It On”—sued Sheeran for $100 million, alleging that he copy-and-pasted a four-chord progression from the song for his Grammy-winning bop “Thinking Out Loud.” Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. On the one hand…the chord progression does sound almost identical. He won one case and settled another out of court. His defense team claims that there are over a dozen songs that use the same chord progression, including some that predate “Let’s Get It On.”Big picture: Copyright infringement claims have been popping up more frequently in the music industry in recent years. And the plaintiff’s lawyer said a video of Sheeran singing a mashup of the two songs at a concert is the star’s “confession.” —MM</description>

  <title>Disney takes DeSantis feud to the next level</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe battle between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and one of the state’s largest employers is getting hotter than the final plate in the Hot Ones Challenge. Disney filed its suit almost immediately after the board hand-picked by DeSantis to govern the district voted to nullify land use agreements made by the previous Disney-controlled board. Back before Disney’s CEO called out the governor in front of investors and DeSantis threatened to build a prison next to Disney World, Disney benefited from Florida’s business-friendly climate. Disney and DeSantis have been dueling like Peter Pan and Captain Hook ever since the company criticized the so-called “Don’t Say Gay” law last spring, and yesterday Disney sued DeSantis, claiming he orchestrated a campaign of retaliation against the company for exercising its free speech rights. The feud hinges on control of the special district where Disney World sits. —CC The suit notes that its existing contracts with the state of Florida would invest $17 billion in Disney World and create 13,000 jobs over the next decade. From a spoonful of sugar to a 74-page lawsuitDisney’s suit accuses DeSantis of a “relentless campaign to weaponize government power against Disney in retaliation for expressing a political viewpoint.”</description>

Since Heinerscheid became the first woman ever to lead Bud Light’s marketing last June, she set out to revive the declining brand by appealing to women and younger people. According to Beer Business Daily, Bud Light sales fell 10.7% the week ended April 8, while shares in rival Molson Coors appear to have gotten at least a short-term lift. This partnership did not sit well with many conservatives, who attacked Bud Light for being another corporation that went “woke” by prioritizing inclusivity.

Zoom out: The UN says that India’s population could start declining in 2047. It’s due to surpass China as the most populous country on the planet this year, according to a UN report released this week. The India “buy” caseIndia has a lot going for it, including a massive labor force. India has already eclipsed its former colonizer, the United Kingdom, as the world’s fifth-largest economy, and it’s projected to nick Germany’s No. 4 spot by 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal. What’s holding India back? —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There are 900 million(! But India also has plenty of homegrown success stories. India’s domination of the global economy is far from guaranteed. India better put on some shades or risk being blinded by the spotlight. And word on the pundit street is that it’s poised to get bigger in another way—by rivaling China and the US as a major economic superpower. It’s paying off: Companies looking to diversify their supply chains away from China have embraced India as an alternative manufacturing hub. And that number is increasing—unlike in most major economies, where an aging population is sapping economic growth. Let’s explore why India’s future looks bright, and some of the obstacles on its path to international economic stardom. Apple recently began assembling its new iPhone in the country, and Volvo signaled it might start building EVs there. Nobel Prize-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee thinks India should look inward before it projects its economic ambitions abroad.</description>

One solution: Get some corporate roommates by subleasing part or all of their office space to other companies. But that doesn’t work for a company that already has a lease, and it doesn’t give the owner the option of ending the sublease at some point when their own company is big enough to fill all the desks—which Paffmann told the Brew can be one reason companies, like the one he worked with, sublease in the first place. According to Mobley, Publicis has listed their space so one company could take over the whole building, or multiple tenants could divvy it up. Michael Paffmann, CEO of VirgoPR, told Morning Brew his company subleases NYC office space from a larger company for eight employees who go in to work two to three times a week. And while Mobley said timesharing is a trend (and has been for a long time for medical offices), he said, “It doesn’t appear to be a big enough trend in traditional office use to really be moving the needle at this point.” Over 250 million square feet of office space is currently available for sublease. For instance, one company comes in on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, while another uses the desks on Wednesday and Friday.</description>
