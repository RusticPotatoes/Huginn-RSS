  <title>Kate Noel, Head of People Ops at Morning Brew, Shares Advice with Readers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4613%2Fkate_s_column.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the happy medium that shows you take this interview seriously but also that you are cool enough to hire and be part of all the virtual company events to come.

  <title>Biden Releases $2.3 Trillion Infrastructure Plan to Boost US Competitiveness and Combat Climate Change</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F781%2F1_train_in_nyc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biden will introduce Part 2 of his economic spending proposal in the next few weeks, called the American Family Plan. To help pay for it, Biden wants to bump up the corporate tax from 21% to 28% and close other tax loopholes. For the climate, the plan “would be the most far-reaching federal investment to date in programs that would help curb greenhouse gas emissions,” writes Axios. $400 billion to caregiving efforts for the elderly and those with disabilities.  $650 billion to improve your life at home, including investments in high-speed broadband and the electric grid.</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Writers Pick the Top Business News Story of Q1</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4567%2Fgamestop_stock_falls_more.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To me, that's what made GameStop mania the biggest story of the quarter—the broader financial world was forced to acknowledge the power of social media users to move markets. It feels like we're in the early stages of so many emerging crypto applications and I'm excited for what's to come.   I'm hopeful that, as the rollout continues, businesses will be able to operate at full throttle and we can tentatively start seeing what this hyped New Normal thing is all about. The US has done a really good job—as of Tuesday, about 15% of Americans are fully vaccinated and we're on pace to administer 200 million shots in Biden's first 100 days.</description>

  <title>Reader Q&amp;A: What Is Financial Leverage?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2F14rfBl2RMAHtCM%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea is to borrow money to make purchases that, over time, can make you far more money than your initial capital could.  In the financial world, investors use the term "leverage" to refer to debt that's used to fund transactions. But while leverage can increase your reward, it can also increase risk, which is where the story of this hedge fund, Archegos Capital Management, comes in.  </description>

  <title>US Home Prices Hit 7-Year High</title>

But as the pool of would-be buyers has grown, supply's gotten tighter than a Lower East Side kitchen: In February, available homes fell by nearly a third to just over 1 million.   </description>

Union organizers may bring up Amazon's anti-union messaging campaign at the warehouse, which even followed workers into the bathroom. Plus, workers already get healthcare, vision, and dental benefits without paying union dues.</description>

Platforms like Cameo and Substack were already getting more popular as fans sought out a more direct connection with creators, but the pandemic made backstage content = all content.  Also in 2020, the similar-but-significantly-more-NSFW platform OnlyFans made $300 million in profit on $400 million in revenue, per The Information.</description>
