Q2 revenue jumped 214% annually, propelling DoorDash to the first profitable quarter for a food delivery company. DoorDash reportedly priced its shares at $102 a pop, which, on a fully diluted basis, would equate to about a $39 billion market cap. ¬† ¬† Why the hype? As food delivery companies went wheel-to-wheel in cities, DoorDash opted for a market with less competition: the 'burbs.</description>

And with DoorDash commissions climbing as high as 30%, restaurants may look for cheaper options. ¬† ¬† Why the hype? Raising $3+ billion should help. Monthly subscribers have more than tripled to 5 million, and 390,000+ merchants use its app. Is the balance sheet keeping up?</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Grammar Blog, No. 6: Rules Are Rules, Except When They‚Äôre Not</title>

But in some instances, we don‚Äôt need to avoid the passive voice like it‚Äôs an indoor gathering‚Äîbecause it‚Äôs not actually important who‚Äôs doing the acting. ¬† Unhelpful Rule No. 2: Passive voice = writer jail¬† What‚Äôs the passive voice? ¬† Bottom line: Correct sentences are correct sentences; length is irrelevant. Grammar ‚Äúrules‚Äù are really more like guidelines that come with asterisks and exceptions and unlesses. This is a series about grammar and style.</description>

  <title>Q3 2020 Recap</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/Jl4M6CA3Id6Op5SXRD/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professional golf has been underway for months with only minor testing headaches, while the pandemic-era versions of the Tour de France, the U.S. Open in tennis, and the Kentucky Derby went off smoothly. If the first two quarters of the year meant us coming to terms with a global pandemic, Q3 saw us settling into a ~new normal~ of face masks, parking lot dining, and saying "whoops, sorry!" ¬† So what about K-12? ¬† Q3 was the busiest for public offerings since the dot-com era. ¬† That was a lot. ¬† The election, for one. ¬† Over the last three months, extreme weather events made more intense and frequent by human-induced climate change have ravaged communities across the country. There's actually good news. ¬† Pulse check on the economic recovery¬† It's... ¬† So why are biz leaders wearing out DocuSign? ¬† Looking ahead On the monetary side... ¬† On the corporate side... ¬† On the fiscal side... ¬† Looking ahead... School Reopenings Test Students, College Towns, and Parents After schools across the country closed their doors in the spring, John Krasinski hosted virtual prom, graduation ceremonies were streamed online, and at least one student accidentally said, ‚ÄúSup, b****?‚Äù ¬† Soccer: A¬† This summer, the National Women's Soccer League became the first major U.S. sports league to return to action from the Covid break, while the MLS has already welcomed fans back in certain states. ¬†¬† How the Economic Recovery Fared in Q3 As the ink dries on Q3, nearly 900,000 Americans are filing new jobless claims each week. ¬† The Atlantic Coast produced so many big tropical storms that the World Meteorological Organization depleted its list of 21 names by September and is now using the Greek alphabet. Even where students can attend school, many parents have chosen not to enroll them. University of Iowa students angered Twitter (an easy feat, really) by lining up for downtown bars in Iowa City, which earlier this month had the fourth-highest Covid-19 cases per capita in the U.S. But for local businesses like The Airliner bar, students returning to campus is their only lifeline‚Äîrevenue was $0 in April. ¬† Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images Parts of the West Coast have been ablaze since August, with a record 3.7 million acres burned across California. Climate change is no longer one of those problems. the M&amp;A could keep flowing, but experts think the IPO frenzy will settle by late October. ¬† Whether you want to relive summer 2020 or would rather pretend it never happened, we present: the Brew's third quarter recap. Basketball: A+¬† Zero NBA players have tested positive for Covid-19 since entering the famous "bubble" in Orlando. The Tampa Bay Rays, the Brew‚Äôs July pick to win it all, entered the postseason as the top team in the American League. But with the election and a Supreme Court fight ahead, don't hold your breath for more emergency aid until the Christmas lights come out.</description>
