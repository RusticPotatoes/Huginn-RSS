For its part, the NCAA claims that compensating student athletes would undermine the “amateur” flavor of college sports, damaging fans' enjoyment of the product.

  <title>Money Matters: Retirement Saving Comes in Two Flavors</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4692%2Fbudget_scale.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer your question, those sweet, sweet tax benefits of 401(k) and IRA retirement plans come in two flavors: traditional and Roth. If you’re unsure of your retirement plans (fair) use this rule of thumb: Prioritize Roth if you’re early in your career, and traditional options if you’re mid- to late-career. The company is offering a 401(k) plan, but I also have a separate Roth IRA. Which one should I prioritize maxing out first?</description>

  <title>What to Know About NYC's Upcoming Mayoral Election</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5486%2Fnew_york_city_mayoral_cam.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Last October, more than 150 business leaders sent a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio saying that degrading quality of life could hinder the city's economic recovery.  Ranked-choice voting means that instead of checking one name off on a ballot, NYC voters will be able to put down up to five, ranked by their preference. Although the Republican primary is also happening on Tuesday, in bright-blue NYC the Democratic winner is basically a shoo-in to win the general election in November. With 13 candidates on the ballot for the Democratic primary, it's the biggest field in the city's history.  Who is running?</description>
