  <title>What You Need to Know About Elizabeth Holmes’s Trial That Starts Today</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/wnqrlUsg38l8sqcWMi/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611676244cc2d5d769553cfe73a113c32838f0da11a&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here’s a quick timeline for everyone who was too young or busy in the aughts: 2003: At the age of 19, Elizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford and started Theranos with the goal of revolutionizing blood testing. Jury selection begins today for the criminal fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of shuttered Silicon Valley biotech startup Theranos. Holmes’s net worth also grew to $4.5 billion, good enough for No. 1 on the Forbes list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women. From there, investors started suing for fraud, the government yanked the company’s blood-testing license, and in September 2018, the SEC dissolved Theranos. — MM</description>

  <title>What You Need to Know About Elizabeth Holmes’s Trial That Starts Today</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/wnqrlUsg38l8sqcWMi/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611676244cc2d5d769553cfe73a113c32838f0da11a&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jury selection begins today for the criminal fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of shuttered Silicon Valley biotech startup Theranos. Holmes’s net worth also grew to $4.5 billion, good enough for No. 1 on the Forbes list of America’s Richest Self-Made Women. Fall into a Theranos rabbit hole: The WSJ reporter who broke the story, John Carreyrou, wrote a riveting book about the fraud called Bad Blood. The downfall of Theranos may have briefly scared investors into looking closer at pitch decks, but it may take more than a conviction to change the Valley’s entrenched “fake it ’til you make it” mindset. Balwani’s lawyers called the claims “deeply offensive.”</description>

Now, rent prices in 87 of the country’s 100 largest cities have fully returned to pre-pandemic levels.  The website Apartment List explained some of the trends behind the trend.</description>

  <title>Oxygen Runs in Short Supply for Covid-19 Patients, Water Treatment, and Space Missions</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6439%2Foxygen_tank.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid oxygen is used to treat the water supply, but the city is running low because of the crush of Covid hospitalizations.   But diverting oxygen to hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients means it can’t be deployed for other uses. As if the Southeast US didn’t have enough to deal with already, hospitals are running low on oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients, and it’s causing ripple effects for other industries that use the stuff for their daily operations.</description>

  <title>Powerfull Hurricane Ida Makes Landfall in Louisiana</title>

Hurricane Ida slammed into Louisiana on exactly the same date, Aug. 29, as Katrina did in 2005.  The entire city of New Orleans was left without power, according to the regional energy provider Entergy.  Looking ahead... If refineries suffer a direct hit, gas prices could rise by about 10 cents in many East Coast markets. And 60% of gasoline used on the East Coast comes from Gulf Coast refineries.</description>

Now, rent prices in 87 of the country’s 100 largest cities have fully returned to pre-pandemic levels.</description>

  <title>How Tim Cook Changed Apple in the 10 Years He's Been CEO</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/TLm3ig25UPL7roCPLC/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That’s right, Cook has been the CEO of Apple for exactly 10 years this week. Cook still has plenty of problems to deal with, from high-stakes legal challenges against Apple’s App Store policies to a more vocal workforce to thorny privacy questions. While the iPhone still reigns supreme, Apple has expanded its hardware lineup in the last decade and scored hits with the Apple Watch and AirPods. It also made a big move into services (Apple Pay, Apple Music, etc. Looking ahead... did (admittedly a low bar). What did your partner get you for your 10th anniversary?</description>

  <title>‘Monster’ Mike Schultz Talks the Paralympic Games, Winning Gold in 2018, and Disney Channel Original Movies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6433%2Fmike_schultz.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What’s more difficult: Winning a gold medal at the Paralympics or starting a company? But running a business or starting a business is an ongoing set of challenges. I'm going to have to go watch it again and refresh my memory.  To learn about what it takes to be a Paralympic champion, we chatted with gold medal-winning snowboarder Mike Schultz. After my injury in 2008, I really started spending a lot more time with the horses. What is something most people don't know about competing at the Paralympics? Yes, it's been a long time.  When I won gold and was able to stand on top of the podium and listen to the national anthem start playing, man, that is a very powerful moment that not many people get to experience.</description>

  <title>Same-day Streaming Causes Movie Piracy to Ramp Up</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3303%2Ftv_movie_theater.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While streaming platforms may recoup some money lost to piracy via digital rentals and subscriber growth (which has boomed for Disney+, HBO Max, and Netflix), theaters won’t see a cent of that. Black Widow was the most pirated movie in the world for three weeks running after it was released on Disney+ and in theaters on July 9, according to piracy-monitoring site TorrentFreak. What pirated movies used to look like: shaky camcorder recordings of movies taken in theaters and uploaded to piracy sites. Black Widow, The Suicide Squad, Jungle Cruise, and other would-be blockbusters simultaneously debuted in theaters and on streaming services in summer 2021. Theater owners are blaming the recent phenomenon of same-day releases for a spike in piracy.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Happiness Expert Dr. Laurie Santos</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6395%2Fdr_laurie_santos.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But joking aside, I think one of the things you learn when you study primates in particular is that humans really are just animals ultimately.  The most important tip is realizing that rejection really hurts. On the one hand, pictures can help us remember things better, which helps us to access all our fondest moments. But the good news is that those self-reports are valid for happiness and well-being. Take time to write down the things you like about yourself, why you’re valued. So really the best way to know if you're happy is to ask yourself. One of the great things about being the person who teaches a happiness class is that I have to practice what I preach.  The best way to know if you're happy is to ask yourself, “How am I feeling right now?” But if taking pictures means that you're worrying about how your hair looks or forcing people out of the moment to take a picture, then they might not be such a good idea.   Santos was kind enough to grant us time during office hours to ask a few questions. Meet up with the people who really care about you, and if you can't meet up with them directly, then do some “social snacking” and just look at pictures of people who are close to you. That’ll allow you to have a memento that will help you remember after the fact.</description>
