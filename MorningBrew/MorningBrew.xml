  <title>8 Charts that Explore Racial Disparities in the Banking Industry</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5081%2Fblack_wall_street_main_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's break it down by genderWhile there were more than 2x the number of Black women working in financial services at the professional level than Black men in 2018, their representation at the top was lower: 1.4% of executive/senior officials are Black men compared to 1.3% of Black women. Francis Scialabba But at the tippy top, &lt;4% of the top managers identified as Black at most big banks. The presence of fewer Black banks can have an impact on local communities, the Urban Institute writes: "As technology has allowed larger banks to deepen their market penetration without the need for physical branches, physical community bank branches are often the last defense between a community and banking isolation. Francis Scialabba That lack of capital has been a big constraint on many Black banks' abilities to lend and expand. Black banks are a small piece of the pieWhile the dollar value of assets held by all MDIs increased more than 3.5x over the last two decades, the share held by Black banks has fallen to &lt;2% the total. At the end of 2020, there were just 20 Black banks. you know the drillThe average share of Black employees classified at the first/mid level at those same banks was 6.9%.  On average, Black workers accounted for 7.9% of professional workers. You can find the remaining 20 Black banks... Francis Scialabba Black banks typically practice relationship banking: a more consultative approach that involves getting to know a customer and their needs and offering a variety of products and services. Across their total employee base, four—JPMorgan, Bank of America, PNC, and Capital One—had a 13% or greater share of Black employees (similar to the population at large, in which Black Americans were last estimated at 13.4%). Black banks have a longevity and capital problem. Wall Street's not the only streetOne way the US government has tried to narrow the racial wealth gap is by supporting Black-owned banks. Wall Street has a diversity problem.</description>

  <title>Pale, Yale, and Male No More: Wall Street Rethinks Recruiting</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5108%2Frecruiting_at_big_banks.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In June of last year, Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf explained in a company-wide memo that the reason his company didn’t have more Black employees was because “there is a very limited pool of Black talent to recruit from.” ’ And I think that's the problem.”   Out of roughly 100,000 financial firm executives in the US, just 2,644 were Black in 2018, according to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Since the Black Lives Matter movement put a spotlight on diversity in the workforce last summer, Wall Street has expanded on old methods for finding Black finance talent and created some new strategies. Less than 25% of four-year historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) even offer finance degrees. Goldman Sachs Global Head of Corporate Engagement Asahi Pompey says, “Lots of Black students and HBCU students fall into a category where, without any real exposure to what that career can look like, it becomes a door that's closed before we even had a chance to open it.” Hive’s Slosar says technology, such as algorithms that learn how to find the best candidates, can replace most personal referrals. you have to go where Black people are if you want to recruit Black people.” One of those: lack of diversity at corporations, especially ones that had posted black squares on social media or donated money to combating racial injustice.  In 2018, one-quarter junior bankers came from just 10 schools, according to a study from job search site Wall Street Oasis.  Scharf was one of many executives responding to the growing Black Lives Matter movement, which began with scrutinizing police forces for their role in the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, but expanded to highlight the broader obstacles facing Black Americans.</description>

  <title>Traditional IPO vs SPAC: Everything You Need to Know About Taking Your Company Public</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F931%2Fstock_exchange.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a company to go public via a SPAC, a SPAC has to want to take that company public. But with 400+ SPACs strolling around with a box of donuts begging new companies to join them for a “new kind of worship,” companies have a lot of opportunities to, um, SPAC it up. Coinbase, the crypto exchange, used a direct listing to go public Wednesday. A reverse merger is when a private company merges with any public company—it doesn’t have to be a shell company—and goes public in the process. A SPAC raises money through the IPO process, and then merges with a private company and takes it public. In a Dutch auction, the company decides the number of shares, but not how much they will cost.  Why would a company want to go public in the first place? A SPAC is formed before it even knows what it wants to do with its life. A private company goes public without any of the underwriting hullabaloo. SPACs might feel like a hot new craze, but they aren’t new. Reverse mergers were popular in the ’80s for pretty much the same reason SPACs are popular right now, but the SEC cracked down in 2011 when it issued a fraud warning about reverse mergers and suspended trading for more than 800 companies. There are other ways to take your company public. But have no fear, someone somewhere will come up with something new... In a direct listing, the company goes public by bypassing investment banks that buy up a lot of initial shares and decide its opening price. They have become increasingly popular because they help companies go public a lot quicker (a few weeks to months) and less time = fewer fees.</description>

  <title>Black Investors Trade Their Way Through the Pandemic</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5083%2Frobinhood_black_wall_street.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  29% of young Black Americans became first-time investors in 2020, compared to 16% of white Americans.  Because when you look at the types of people who have typically invested in stocks, Black Americans are less represented. According to the Ariel-Schwab Black Investor Survey, 63% of Black Americans under the age of 40 are now participating in the stock market, the same share as white Americans.  Here’s the lesser-known story: That surge in individual trading was led by a historic rise in the number of Black investors getting into the stock market. For Ross and Mac, it’s not surprising that cryptocurrency, with its promise to bypass entrenched financial institutions, is particularly enticing to Black investors.  For Ross and other Black Americans who grew up in disadvantaged communities (Ross is the first person in his family to graduate from high school), more access to the stock market via mobile apps means an unprecedented opportunity to grow wealth and participate in a financial system that at one point seemed so distant.  On the audio app Clubhouse, Ross Mac runs a weekly chat called Black Wealth Matters, which aims to help build “generational wealth in the Black community.”  Not having any money invested in the stock market can dramatically harm your ability to build wealth down the road. Mac, a former Wall Street analyst and financial literacy teacher, says that the pandemic has created a rush of excitement around stocks and investing among Black Americans. )Did the proliferation of no-fee trading apps contribute to the wave of new Black investors that emerged over the last year? It’s a very easy thing for us to get and understand because as a people we’ve been shut out,” Ross said.</description>

The most creative strategy, however, goes to writer Matty Merritt, who tripled down on her Nebraska roots with a portfolio made exclusively from corn.</description>

Ask Kate for advice here. I just read your response to the person looking at changing jobs. —AshleyA: Hi Ashley, I’m sorry that your experience at work has turned into a sour one. Do you have any advice on how to have that conversation gracefully? Notices longer than two weeks is an awesome look on you, too (side note: I would recommend a minimum of three weeks if you’re at the Director level or higher). And please please give your employer a two-week notice, meaning 10 full business days, at minimum. Oh!</description>
