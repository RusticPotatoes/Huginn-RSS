The report revealed that Harvard directly profited from slavery for centuries as it became America’s preeminent university. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeFollowing a substantial report detailing its historical ties to slavery, segregation, and discrimination, Harvard University announced yesterday that it will commit $100 million to further study and redress those ties. The report’s authors—a committee of Harvard faculty members—made a series of recommendations to work as a foundation to redress the institution’s legacy. Among its other findings:More than 70 Black and Native American people were enslaved by Harvard faculty and staff between 1636 and 1783. Rather than direct financial reparations to the descendants of enslaved people, the report recommends the fund be used to improve educational opportunities for descendants, establish relationships with Black colleges and universities, and honor enslaved people through memorials, curriculum, and research.</description>

The report revealed that Harvard directly profited from slavery for centuries as it became America’s preeminent university. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeFollowing a substantial report detailing its historical ties to slavery, segregation, and discrimination, Harvard University announced yesterday that it will commit $100 million to further study and redress those ties. The report’s authors—a committee of Harvard faculty members—made a series of recommendations to work as a foundation to redress the institution’s legacy. Among its other findings:More than 70 Black and Native American people were enslaved by Harvard faculty and staff between 1636 and 1783. Rather than direct financial reparations to the descendants of enslaved people, the report recommends the fund be used to improve educational opportunities for descendants, establish relationships with Black colleges and universities, and honor enslaved people through memorials, curriculum, and research.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Let’s see that executive order first, Joe.The new ‘Vette will join the growing list of notorious, engine-revving, sleeveless-shirt-wearing-macho-dude vehicles being electrified. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! GM President Mark Reuss said that Chevy will sell an “electrified” (AKA hybrid, probably) Corvette next year, and eventually make it all-electric. GM said last June it would invest $35 billion through 2025 to boost EV- and autonomous vehicle (AV) tech, including spending $7 billion to build a Michigan battery plant and update other factories in the state for EV production. Last August, President Biden even joked during a speech, “When they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it.” Last July, Dodge said it would release an EV muscle car in 2024. There’s been a lot of anticipation for the iconic sports car’s non-gas version since GM said in January 2021 it would commit to exclusively selling EVs by 2035. Zoom out: Legacy automakers are betting it all on an electric future. And Ford slapped the Mustang name on its first electric SUV in 2019.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. People in the “everyone is overreacting” camp say that Elon’s Twitter will be a series of marginal tweaks and endless compromises that may not move the needle one way or the other. With Twitter treading water, some tech analysts, such as Stratechery’s Ben Thompson, say that Musk—who has a history of creating really valuable companies—could unlock Twitter’s potential by better monetizing Twitter’s influential user base consisting of leaders in tech, media, and finance. Further reading: 1) Everything Elon Musk said he wants to change about Twitter and 2) a grand theory of what Elon’s up to with Twitter. Putting all of the control of Twitter in the hands of one person—let alone one with a variety of business interests around the globe—would be just as damaging, critics argue.</description>

Let’s see that executive order first, Joe.The new ‘Vette will join the growing list of notorious ,engine-revving, sleeveless-shirt-wearing-macho-dude vehicles being electrified. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! GM President Mark Reuss said that Chevy will sell an “electrified” (AKA hybrid, probably) Corvette next year, and eventually make it all-electric. GM said last June it would invest $35 billion through 2025 to boost EV- and autonomous vehicle (AV) tech, including spending $7 billion to build a Michigan battery plant and update other factories in the state for EV production. Last August, President Biden even joked during a speech, “When they make the first electric Corvette, I get to drive it.” Last July, Dodge said it would release an EV muscle car in 2024. There’s been a lot of anticipation for the iconic sports car’s non-gas version since GM said in January 2021 it would commit to exclusively selling EVs by 2035. Zoom out: Legacy automakers are betting it all on the electric game. And Ford slapped the Mustang name on its first electric SUV in 2019.</description>

  <title>Twitter and Elon Musk agree to $44 billion deal to take the company private.</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/cb9a8a882c5c87268247c5399dab7b125ece8666-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. People in the “everyone is overreacting” camp say that Elon’s Twitter will be a series of marginal tweaks and endless compromises that may not move the needle one way or the other. With Twitter treading water, some tech analysts, such as Stratechery’s Ben Thompson, say that Musk—who has a history of creating really valuable companies—could unlock Twitter’s potential by better monetizing Twitter’s influential user base consisting of leaders in tech, media, and finance. Further reading: 1) Everything Elon Musk said he wants to change about Twitter and 2) a grand theory of what Elon’s up to with Twitter. Putting all of the control of Twitter in the hands of one person—let alone one with a variety of business interests around the globe—would be just as damaging, critics argue.</description>

A spokesperson for Esso, an Exxon subsidiary that placed the order, said the company had made the purchase before Russia launched its invasion and had no plans to buy more Russian oil. Greenpeace Norway leader Frode Pleym said the action was in protest of Norway buying Russian oil, “which we know finances Putin’s warfare.” What you’re looking at: Environmental activists chained themselves to a tanker that was offloading its cargo of 105,000+ tons of Russian oil in a Norway port.</description>

The protest song “Do You Hear The People Sing?” css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! css-y2oq5g[data-disabled]{opacity:0.5;cursor:not-allowed;box-shadow:var(--chakra-shadows-none);}. css-1dlcpt7[data-disabled]{opacity:0.4;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,. They’re the most senior-ranking US officials to visit the city since Russia’s invasion, though many top European leaders have already been to Kyiv to talk with Zelensky. Shanghai authorities were seen erecting green fences around residential areas in an apparent attempt to keep people in the locked-down city from leaving their homes. Apparently Musk’s ability to come up with $46.5 billion in financing changed leadership’s thinking from vehemently opposed to “OK, maybe we should negotiate.” Twitter is reevaluating Elon Musk’s bid to buy the company for $43 billion, the WSJ reported.</description>
