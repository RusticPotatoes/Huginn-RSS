  <title>Lumber Prices Post Biggest Weekly Loss Ever</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4744%2Flumber_prices.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Is higher-priced lumber the new normal? For context: Since the early '90s, lumber futures have mostly traded between $200 and $600. Strong demand will probably keep lumber prices above pre-pandemic levels for at least 1–2 years, according to BMO analyst Mark Wilde.</description>

  <title>CEO and CFO of Electric Vehicle Maker Lordstown Motors Resign</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5444%2Flordstown_motors.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hindenburg investigation also led to the departure of executive chairman Trevor Milton at Nikola, another electric truck startup that went public via SPAC.  Last year, Steve Burns, founder and now the former CEO, helped drive the company public via SPAC, one of many electric automakers to go public by merging with a blank-check company. The Ford F-150 frunk might be as good as it’s going to get for electric trucks this year. Lordstown stock climbed more than 200% last summer.</description>

  <title>Gaming's Preeminent Conference, E3, Is This Weekend</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5420%2Favatar.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;E3 has been losing exhibitors and, some argue, relevance ever since its ’00s heyday when, for instance, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr went on stage to promote The Beatles: Rock Band.  Big picture: Sony and EA are skipping the showcase. Nintendo could use tomorrow's announcement reel to finally unveil a new-and-improved Nintendo Switch.</description>

  <title>MLB Expected to Address Sticky Stuff Controversy in Coming Days</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1193%2Fbaseball_stadium.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitchers themselves aren't exactly pushing back. Well, the advantage pitchers gain from the sticky stuff may be contributing to one of the most pitiful batting displays in baseball's long history. Boosting offenses and maintaining what’s left of MLB’s integrity is critical to the long-term success of the league.</description>

Besides one hilarious mixup over uneven gifting, the headline announcement was a pledge to send 1 billion Covid vaccine doses to lower-income countries through Covax, the joint initiative of the WHO and the Gavi vaccine alliance.</description>
