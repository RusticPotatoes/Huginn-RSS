  <title>Money Matters: Retirement Saving Comes in Two Flavors</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4692%2Fbudget_scale.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To answer your question, those sweet, sweet tax benefits of 401(k) and IRA retirement plans come in two flavors: traditional and Roth. If you’re unsure of your retirement plans (fair) use this rule of thumb: Prioritize Roth if you’re early in your career, and traditional options if you’re mid- to late-career. The company is offering a 401(k) plan, but I also have a separate Roth IRA. Which one should I prioritize maxing out first?</description>

  <title>Canada Extends Border Restrictions With the US</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/31WY9AkAiJSUaDYri8/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, Canada extended restrictions on nonessential travel across the US border until July 22. Big picture: Canadian and American businesses that rely on cross-border traffic are getting FOMO as other countries open up to international travelers. to keep the virus at bay, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said the border would stay mostly closed until 75% of the population has received the first dose and 20% have been fully vaccinated.</description>

  <title>What to Know About NYC's Upcoming Mayoral Election</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5486%2Fnew_york_city_mayoral_cam.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Last October, more than 150 business leaders sent a letter to Mayor Bill de Blasio saying that degrading quality of life could hinder the city's economic recovery.  Ranked-choice voting means that instead of checking one name off on a ballot, NYC voters will be able to put down up to five, ranked by their preference. Although the Republican primary is also happening on Tuesday, in bright-blue NYC the Democratic winner is basically a shoo-in to win the general election in November. With 13 candidates on the ballot for the Democratic primary, it's the biggest field in the city's history.  Who is running?</description>
