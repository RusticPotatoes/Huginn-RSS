  <title>Extra Unemployment Benefits Are Drying Up </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5571%2Fus-unemployment-job.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Businesses are desperate to hire workers, and many states think scrapping the extra $300/week in unemployment benefits, which the Biden administration incorporated into its pandemic relief bill, will spur more job-seeking.  In the states that cut off the extra payments the earliest, the number of workers who were paid benefits decreased 13.8% from mid-May to mid-June. On Capitol Hill last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that extra benefits could be playing a role in the worker shortage problem, but focused his attention on other challenges holding back the job market.</description>

Businesses are desperate to hire workers, and many states think scrapping the extra $300/week in unemployment benefits, which the Biden administration incorporated into its pandemic relief bill, will spur more job-seeking. Ten more states including Florida, Ohio, and Texas ended extra unemployment benefits on Saturday. Earlier this month, the job site Indeed found that job search activity fell below the national trend in states that cut off extra benefits in June.</description>

  <title>F1 Is Having a Moment in the United States</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5558%2Ff1_winter_testing_in_barc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Last week, Formula 1 re-upped its partnership with the sports merchandise retailer Fanatics after sales on the online F1 store popped 40% globally in 2020. F101: A Formula 1 season typically consists of 20+-races in glamorous locations like Monaco, Abu Dhabi, and Portugal. It's got that kind of power," he told The Drive about the new F1 race. F1 has added a race there for the 2022 season, which—along with Austin—makes for two races held in the US on the same calendar. And I think it's going to be something that redefines who we are. The Brew's Formula 1 Slack channel is the fastest-growing micro-community at the company.  But Formula 1 has been around since 1950. I think this is one of those macro events, like Art Basel. They actually change the city.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with… Chef José Andrés</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5560%2Fjose_andres.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It's the people of India coming together to heal and feed the people of India—it's really amazing. Can you tell us about your experience there? Back home, do you see #ChefsforAmerica winding down as we move out of the pandemic, or continuing in some other form? You and WCK recently spent some time in India serving meals to frontline workers. There are six days left to donate to Morning Brew's fundraiser for World Central Kitchen and secure a copy of our digital cookbook, Brunch with the Brew. You'll just have to follow me on TikTok for the best ones…maybe you can start with making cocktails in the snow. There are so many! You only get to eat one condiment for the rest of your life. They don't need to go stand in line for hours, and instead can pick up a meal from a restaurant or get it delivered, which hopefully makes it a little easier for families to get through the day.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/LdOyjZ7io5Msw/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Is it worth getting a financial advisor, and if so, how do I choose one?

Nike predicted it’ll pass $50 billion in revenue this fiscal year for the first time thanks in part to a rapidly growing e-commerce biz. Looking ahead...</description>

  <title>Supreme Court Hands Down Major Rulings on Farms, Free Speech, and Fannie and Freddie</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5535%2Fsupreme_court.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the Supreme Court struck down a regulation that allowed union organizers to meet with agricultural workers during some periods of the day. The Supreme Court didn’t buy that, but did concede that the structure of the agency that oversees Fannie and Freddie is unconstitutional.  Bottom line: Because Levy didn’t bully anyone or post her frustrations during school, SCOTUS said she had the right to be an angry teen. The school banned Levy from cheer for a full year and her (clearly cool) dad got the ACLU involved, claiming that the school violated her First Amendment rights.</description>
