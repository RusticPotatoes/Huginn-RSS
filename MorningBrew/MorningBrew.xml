Last Wednesday, an appeals court reinstated a Texas law that bans social media companies from moderating content on their platforms based on “the viewpoint of the user or another person.” But that removal would have seemingly violated Texas’s new social media law if it had occurred there. css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>

  <title>‘Succession’ actor’s protest highlights the vegan upcharge</title>

Across the industry, the retail price of nondairy, plant-based milk is around twice the price of dairy milk, according to Mintec, which analyzes food commodity costs. But while those factors may help explain why plant-based milks are expensive, they don’t fully spell out why dairy milk is so cheap. While most people probably aren’t concerned about what the human star of Babe: Pig in the City sticks himself to, Cromwell’s glue-in highlights a reality for vegans and those with dairy allergies: Things tend to cost a lot more. The lactose intolerance taxIn January, Starbucks stores in the UK made all dairy alternatives free. But in the US, Starbucks locations typically charge an additional 70 cents for nondairy options. And it’s not just Starbucks charging a premium, either. So what’s keeping those oat milk prices high? —MK Zoom out: While around 36% of Americans are lactose intolerant (a condition that predominantly affects people of color), the US is still living in its Got Milk? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There’s a higher demand for dairy milk—61% of US households primarily drink it, compared to the 23% that opt for plant-based—so production costs are more spread out and retail prices are cheaper. Given that the carbon footprint of cow milk is about 3x that of alternatives like oat milk, environmental advocates like Cromwell are hoping that removing cost burdens will lead to more people giving nondairy options a chance.</description>

It’s part of a broader trend of airlines investing in faster in-air wi-fi to win over travel-hungry customers, especially now that business travel has started to rebound. But the four biggest US airlines haven’t given Starlink the time of day. A few weeks ago it announced a deal with SpaceX’s Starlink to start installing the service on some planes next year. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe airline obsessed with boarding passengers gladiator-style is spending $2 billion to give the people what they want. They have instead partnered with wi-fi provider Viasat, which Southwest will be working with to roll out better internet for passengers by the fall.</description>
