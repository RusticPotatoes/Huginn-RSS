  <title>Pandemic Recession Was the Shortest Ever</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5841%2Fbounce_back.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pandemic-induced recession lasted only two months, from February 2020 to April 2020, making it the shortest recession in US history. Zoom out: The Covid-19 recession ended an economic boom that began in June 2009 and lasted 128 months, the longest US economic expansion on record.  The US government is certainly acting like the recession is long gone. Let's start the clock again. The federal eviction moratorium ends on July 31.</description>

The pandemic-induced recession lasted only two months, from February 2020 to April 2020, making it the shortest recession in US history. The US government is certainly acting like the recession is over.</description>

  <title>Facebook and Biden in War of Words Over Vaccine Misinformation</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5820%2Fgood_will_hunting.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The social media company pushed back on Saturday against increasing criticism from the White House that the company is allowing the spread of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation. More than 97% of new hospitalizations from the Delta variant are of people who’ve not been vaccinated, the agency said. “The fact is that vaccine acceptance among Facebook users in the US has increased,” the company wrote, citing a study that showed vaccine acceptance among FB users has jumped 10–15 percentage points since January.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...NFL Legend Ndamukong Suh</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5819%2Fndamukong_suh.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s one of those things where I don't think you need to bet all of your money on one thing, but I do think you need to have exposure to it. I had to ask myself, “How do I understand what a budget is?” I remember back in the day a long snapper named Don Muhlbach was one of the few guys in the locker room I would talk to about finance, where he was at with his business, and who he aspired to be. Four sacks in a playoff game or a Super Bowl win—that’d be the best. Some of them I've already accomplished so that’s probably why I didn’t pick them.  No. 1 draft pick Trevor Lawrence is getting his signing bonus paid out in cryptocurrency.  There’s for sure more conversations on those topics in the locker room compared to 2010 when I first got in the league. I don’t see myself putting my salary fully into bitcoin. If you could own one building what would it be? Now, it’s on Reddit and you see all the news about GameStop so I think it’s seen as more “cool” to talk about it and be in the know.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: How Many Credit Cards Is too Many?</title>
