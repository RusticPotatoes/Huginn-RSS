  <title>A Rough Timeline of Covid-19 Immunization in the U.S.</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2921/vaccine_clock.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;January 31, 2021: About 50 million Americans could be vaccinated by now, and, grouped in with those who've recovered from Covid-19, over 30% of the population would be immune, per the dean of Brown's public health school, Ashish Jha. February/March: At 30%–40% immunity, according to Jha, the spread will become "meaningfully slower" and infections won't be "self-sustaining."  </description>

  <title>Who Gets a Vaccine First?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/eoK5GIUKwf0tO/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The U.S.' ~20 million healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses, and support staff, will likely be top priority. #3: Not everyone will get a vaccine.     Who's first? But in 2009, researchers published a study suggesting a focus on vaccinating the biggest spreaders—in the case of swine flu, children ages 5–19—to protect everyone else. Reality check: There won't be enough Covid-19 vaccines for everyone for a while. In the last decade, the U.S. has never vaccinated more than half of adults for the flu, and vaccination rates for Black, Latinx, and high-risk adults trend lower. Other factors to consider #1: Different vaccines have different logistical challenges and health considerations, which could affect who gets what when.</description>

  <title>WHO Covax Initiative Seeks Equitable Access to Covid Vaccines</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3150/covid-19_vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So far, Covax has secured 700 million doses and $2 billion in funding. The goal is to raise $5 billion and provide 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.   Big picture: The Duke Global Health Institute thinks it'll take until 2024 for vaccines to reach the entire population.  The Duke Global Health Institute estimates 9.6 billion doses are already reserved by individual countries, without any vaccines having reached the market yet.</description>

  <title>Vaccination in the Workplace: Employers Advised to "Strongly Encourage"</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3219/vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Labor and employment attorney Michael Roche told Business Insider that the safest legal tack is for companies to "strongly encourage employees to get vaccinated." But can employers legally require their workers to get vaccines?  </description>

  <title>Americans Are Divided Over The Covid-19 Vaccine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/s3Klt17UqDYyI/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Establishing public trust in these vaccines will be the next major challenge for health officials. That's down from a peak of 50% in September, but remains a concerning number for public health officials who want to get Covid-19 under control.  </description>

  <title>Dow Rises to 30,000 and a Fresh Record</title>

Let’s talk about that rally  How it started: The Dow was in the dumps during the onset of the pandemic, trading below 19,000 points in March. Of course, each 10,000 point milestone represents a smaller proportional gain, because math.</description>

  <title>McKesson Will Be the Central Distributor of Covid-19 Vaccines</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3227/former_mckesson_chairman.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The company will not make decisions on where to send the vaccines, however.   Put me in, coach Through Operation Warp Speed, the government has made McKesson the central distributor of Covid-19 vaccines (outside of Pfizer-BioNTech’s, which needs to live in sub-Arctic temps).     Because of McKesson’s expertise in schlepping life-saving material, the country has tapped it for similar programs before. It’s a lucrative business.</description>

  <title>A Quick Teardown of Operation Warp Speed</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3228/operation_warp_speed.png'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Looking ahead...   Budget: Up to $18 billion.   The goal: To deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective vaccine by Jan. 2021. OWS leadership has said they can deliver a Covid-19 vaccine to every state less than 24 hours after FDA approval.</description>

  <title>How Temperature-Sensitive Vaccine Candidates Will be Distributed Via the Cold Chain</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/zoMno34V30kla/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Dry ice is the cold chain’s best friend. Pfizer has designed temperature-controlled dry ice boxes that can maintain a roughly -94° Fahrenheit temperature for up to 10 days.   Bottom line: Even with distributors and drug companies beefing up their cold chain capacity, pharma experts still expect a spoilage rate between 5% and 20%.   Storage is tight.</description>

  <title>One Vaccine Dose’s Journey From Lab to Arm</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/VTLkM7Z0a2I48/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  But not so fast: Moderna’s vaccine requires two doses 28 days apart. The vaccine will fly in those Elsa-approved containers to a McKesson distribution facility in Irving, TX. We just spit a lot of information at you about the vaccine supply chain.</description>

  <title>Vaccine Manufacturing 101: The Brew Breaks it Down</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3074/vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Vaccine manufacturing is Isla de Muerta  It’s an island that cannot be found, except by those who already know where it is.   Plus, it’s not cheap. The total costs of vaccine development can run up to $500 million, one study found.     Step 5: Distribution—mix up all the components in vials or syringes, load those suckers on trucks, and get them in some arms.   Step 3: Next, the antigen is purified through processes that sound like words you’d make up when lying about doing science homework: chromatography and ultrafiltration. Probably not, but Pfizer does. Basil’s gotta become pesto at some point. Scientists do this by literally growing it in a cell—like the basil plant on your window, but tiny.</description>
