  <title>US Hiring Surges in March With Bigger Rebound in Sight</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4621%2Fyou_re_hired_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The economy basically just raised a $1.9 trillion Series E in the form of Biden’s stimulus plan.    The biggest winners: Leisure and hospitality = 280,000 jobs added. The $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal he introduced this week, literally called the American Jobs Plan, would create 13.5 million jobs by the end of his first term, as opposed to 11.4 million without the plan, per Moody’s Analytics. The March jobs report, released yesterday by the Labor Department, was like being on a 12-hour flight next to a crying baby when the captain says, “We have begun our descent.”</description>

  <title>HYBE Acquires Scooter Braun’s Ithaca Holdings for $1 Billion</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.giphy.com%2Fmedia%2FibpyzXXfbiy1UkGRRO%2Fgiphy.gif&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HYBE acquired Ithaca Holdings for about $1 billion yesterday, but unless you own some turntables, you might want a refresher on who these two audio giants are:HYBE is a South Korean music company formerly named Big Hit Entertainment. It’s unclear exactly what that’ll look like, but if BTS’s rabid “Army” fan club backs it, it’ll be big.</description>

  <title>Robert Downey Jr. on His New Sustainability Venture: "I Never Learned Anything While I Was Talking."</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4615%2Frobert_downey_jr.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s a rut that’s so easy to get stuck in. For us [at Footprint], it’s not about being better or smarter. Are you in it because you got stuck and have a lot of shareholders and I’m the halo you’re missing? So I look at the character of the women and men of the team of that company. I’m just reading The Sympathizer. But it’s a starting point to get into the habit of seeing if our ideations on how to do things a little differently, and be part of that bridging between the consumer and the titans of industry and string-pulling politicians. You don’t get an education if you press a space bar, you know? I know that when it comes to the things that keep showing up, I’m real big on refusing the call. It’s just a different feeling. So for me, it was really about the people I met [in service of Footprint Coalition’s mission]. It’s about happening into a moment, a group, an inspiration that was going to hit anyway. You have a year like this, my brother, where our disgust response has gone up—where the powers that be say that something is really scary and you should go hide and we’ll tell you what to do next.   I very seldom know what’s going on. It’s the only spot I’ve ever really felt comfortable in my skin. I find myself in this odd position where I have some leverage; I can get anybody on the phone. I’m in a service industry and we work weekends. It’s like speed-dating at a high level, and sometimes at a low level. A little bit of an existential crisis always helps when you’re looking for a sea change. But my interest was always split between my call sheet and everything else in one bucket. I tend to balk at those firewalls—that doesn’t feel like me. There’s so much overdue inclusivity flooding into what felt like these imaginary bright lines that a smaller group of people had drawn. But it’s hard to turn an ocean liner on a dime. Now I’ve changed. Why turn the page entirely? I quickly realized you have to follow your gut and get cool, smart, influencers around you and see how you can be part of the solution. I’m just playing catch up. It’s crazy because you gotta show up for this. For me, interest over time promotes excellence. I have to thank all the people who are thought-leading this crisis correctly and putting me in a position where I have very little option but to engage. I don’t think [individuals] are that smart. “Is this [sustainability startup] one of those bro games?” Those people are doing that [work]. I always like that. There is not even a Spock-chess version of a capital E-easy beginner answer. What’s your anticipated return on investment? I think there are a lot of people who think they’re the smartest person they’ve ever met. There are four billion soccer kids and one ball.</description>

  <title>What Everyone's Arguing About: $$$ for College Athletes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4616%2Fcollege_basketball.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The backstoryFor more than a century, the NCAA has governed one of the most cherished traditions in America: college sports. There are now college sports video games.  If that makes you go 🤔, then you'd probably be interested in the crucial Supreme Court case over college athlete compensation that kicked off last Wednesday. Nick Saban, the Alabama football coach, will make $9.5 million this year.   They are: Fans enjoy the product specifically because the athletes are amateurs, not paid professionals.  The other sideThe NCAA uses a few different arguments to defend its amateurism model. Athletes are paid in the form of a free college education that might cost others more than $60k a year.</description>

Can I wait until the morning to email her back?  My manager has a tendency to email me at 7–8pm, but I've been trying to keep a healthy work-life balance, which means closing my work laptop at 5:30pm.</description>
