Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who wields a lot of power in the Senate, said he doesn’t support raising the corporate tax rate above 25%.

  <title>The TL;DR of Georgia's Voting Law</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3606%2Fgeorgia_peach.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US has a long history of suppressing voting access for Black and minority populations, and critics say this law continues that practice. More access in some cases: The GA law guarantees a minimum # of drop boxes for mail ballots per county, expands early voting in most small counties, and adds more resources to polling places where lines get long.

  <title>The TL;DR of Georgia's Voting Law</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3606%2Fgeorgia_peach.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US has a long history of suppressing voting access for Black and minority populations, and critics say this law continues that practice. More access in some cases: The GA law guarantees a minimum # of drop boxes for mail ballots per county, expands early voting in most small counties, and adds more resources to polling places where lines get long.  Have another question?</description>
