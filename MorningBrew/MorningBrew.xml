  <title>Economic Data Points to Positive Economic Recovery</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3150%2Fcovid-19_vaccine.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;¬†The growing signs for optimismWhen investors are nervous about what's ahead, they typically buy US Treasury bonds, which sends bond prices higher and yields down. ¬†Still, the latest wave of economic data has some experts hoping that the US is not only on the rebound, but ahead of schedule. Retail sales jumped 5.3% in January, aided by the latest round of stimulus checks. And when he testifies to the Senate and House finance committees this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to continue pressing for more action.</description>

  <title>How a Financial Educator Does Her Taxes: ‚ÄúCovid-19 Has Affected the Way I Ask for Help‚Äù</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4090%2Fberna_anat.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;¬†Berna Anat: My biggest thing when it comes to taxes is: Always ask a legitimate tax professional. ¬†BA: You know, I tend to be very conservative, like, oh, I don‚Äôt think I should deduct that, or, I don‚Äôt think I deserve that grant... ¬†MB: Yes, talk about how you got into financial education in the first place. ¬†MB: Is Covid-19 going to change anything about the way you‚Äôre doing your taxes this year? It‚Äôs kind of redundant now that we‚Äôre talking about it, but it encompasses everything I do with my P&amp;L and my journaling and it goes into a nice little package that my accountant understands at the end of the year. How did you find your legitimate tax professional? That means I can actually get financially organized. Now that you‚Äôre a profitable entrepreneur, how do you keep track of your expenses leading up to tax season? ¬†I spoke with Berna Anat, who torpedoed out of $50,000 in debt and is now a financial educator, about her approach to taxes. You‚Äôre going to get arrested for the tacos. He explained how most monthly expenses that contribute to your work can be considered write-offs, but to run everything by him so I don‚Äôt get carried away. But also, the more the work grew, the more I became concerned about protecting my personal expenses, which are very important to me because that‚Äôs how I got into this whole journey. Morning Brew: You‚Äôre a financial educator, so how do you educate your community about tax season? He‚Äôs like, "OK, let‚Äôs talk about write-offs." I was paying for a full session and wanted to use my time up to the minute. ¬†So, I think Covid-19 has really affected the way I ask for help, and the way that I consider myself a business. If you‚Äôre getting tacos for a business meeting, that voice is like... ¬†I learned that credit card debt is the most shamey debt, so I started by paying off that $12,000 bill. But my business coach and a bunch of other financial educator friends have encouraged me over the past year by saying as an LLC, you‚Äôre a small business‚Äîand you‚Äôre a woman and a person of color‚Äîand you deserve to go after business grants and loans. Because as an individual, I‚Äôm like, I‚Äôm fine.</description>

  <title>Get to Know the GameStop Hearing‚Äôs Five Key Witnesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;¬† ¬†Quote about him: Reddit user reality_czech said, ‚ÄúYour steady hand convinced many of us to not only buy, but hold. Quote from him: Regarding the conspiracy theories that Robinhood was somehow compelled to limit trading by Big Finance, Tenev told Elon Musk on Clubhouse, "There was a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this and that's just false." ¬†Fun fact: The same week that his deal for a 24,000-square-ft penthouse at 220 Central Park South went through, he also bought a mansion near Buckingham Palace that Charles de Gaulle once lived in. Quote about him: Ellen Pao, the former Reddit CEO, emailed Bloomberg, ‚ÄúReddit should be adding a disclaimer because I don‚Äôt believe all 6 million people in the r/wallstreetbets, and the people who followed them, know exactly what they are getting into. ¬†¬†Fun fact: To the public‚Äôs knowledge, Plotkin has no social media accounts‚Äîwhich might be a good thing once you peep around Reddit forums like r/MelvinCapitalLove a little. Today at noon ET, the House Financial Services Committee will get 5 guys. In other words, regulators will want to know if he lied about being bullish on GameStop stock to boost its price for his own profit. Gabe Plotkin¬† Gabe Plotkin Net worth: $300 million, as of April 2018What he does: Founder of the hedge fund Melvin Capital. ¬†His role in the GameStop saga: Citadel the market maker made a lot of moola processing trades that sent GameStop stock ‚Äúto the moon.‚Äù Griffin will also probably answer questions surrounding conspiracy theories, such as whether Citadel teamed up with Robinhood to manipulate stock prices in its favor. Quote from him: ‚ÄúPeople were doing a quick take, saying GameStop was the next Blockbuster. Keith Gill aka Roaring Kitty¬†¬†¬† YouTube Net worth: We don‚Äôt know exactly, but what we do know is that his GameStop stake was worth $22 million earlier this month (when shares were slightly higher than they are now). ¬†At the hearing, regulators will attempt to figure out whether market manipulation played a role in last month‚Äôs Reddit-fueled market mania, and whether any other financial rules were broken in the process. ¬†¬†What he does: Founder of Citadel, a company that has a hand in most corners of the financial world. ¬†¬†¬†Quote about him: Steve Cohen, the billionaire investor whose company Point72 agreed to invest $750 million in Melvin alongside Citadel, said in a statement: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Gabe Plotkin since 2006 and he is an exceptional investor and leader.</description>
