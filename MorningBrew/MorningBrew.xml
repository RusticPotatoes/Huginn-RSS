  <title>April Jobs Report Is a Big Whiff for the US Economy</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2R04CaebgtebcxvG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills mismatch: Perhaps the people looking for jobs don’t have the experience necessary to fill the types of jobs that are open.  Whereas economists had forecasted upwards of 1 million jobs added in April...   Covid reasons: Despite a blazing vaccination rollout in the US, many people might still fear getting infected with the virus at work. After the jobs report was released, the US Chamber of Commerce asked lawmakers to end the extra benefits. What we do know is that there is no shortage of jobs in certain industries like retail, manufacturing, and construction.</description>

  <title>Elon Musk Hosts SNL Even Though His Whole Life Feels Like an Episode of SNL</title>

All played by Melissa Villaseñor. Someone in the audience, Franz, and of course the truck itself. and it shattered.

  <title>Icebreakers with...Carlos Watson</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4992%2Fcarlos_watson.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Next weekend, you can catch Watson asking more famous people questions at this year’s virtual OZY Fest, but for now, we ask the questions... You’ve interviewed lots of famous people in your career, what’s your favorite question to ask? And I love to ask people what their karaoke song is. I wish someone would always ask me, “What are your favorite books?” I’m looking forward to the sun, more of it. I love to ask people the most interesting thing they've ever learned about love—it's a really good insight especially from people like Wynton Marsalis and Ava DuVernay. What is a question that you wish people would ask you? I'm looking forward to seeing my buddy José at the YMCA. I'm looking forward to playing pickup basketball.</description>

  <title>Meet Jasyn Prolifiq, the Dogecoin Millionaire</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4975%2Fjasyn_prolifiq.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;thedogecoinmillionaire. Prolifiq remains bullish about the crypto, but he’s also preparing a content side hustle for life whether dogecoin goes to the moon or burns up before it reaches orbit.  February 7: By 6:59pm ET dogecoin hit $0.08.   Prolifiq first got into investing a few years ago when he bought his first Tesla stock. In February, Elon Musk said that people should not be putting their life savings into cryptocurrency. April 15: Dogecoin hit $0.29 and Prolifiq became a paper millionaire. Prolifiq said he invested ~$180,000 into the meme stock when it was less than $0.05 on February 5, and on April 15, exactly 69 days later—an important number in the doge community because of... “I’m just a dude,” Jasyn Prolifiq said. May 5: Prolifiq’s holdings rose to $2.7 million when dogecoin hit $0.65, up 13,960.31% YTD and close to its all-time high of $0.69, per CoinDesk. He’s already bought the web domain www.  So what about the guy who did?</description>

  <title>Everything You Need to Know About Cryptocurrency and Taxes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Checking out with crypto can trigger a tax billSo you know how investing in your favorite digital coin can affect your taxes, but have you considered what happens when you use crypto to pay for a coffee…or car? Jordan Bass, a tax attorney and founder of Taxing Cryptocurrency, said the IRS isn’t easing off its crackdown on virtual currency taxation. Tax software or a crypto tax professional can help you make sense of it. The IRS really, really wants you to know that cryptocurrency transactions are taxable. In other words, you don’t have to think about taxes on cryptocurrency until you exchange or sell it. Though we call it a “currency,” the IRS doesn’t treat crypto like yen or euros. The campaign’s goal is to snuff out taxpayers who aren’t following the crypto tax rules. In 2019, the IRS sent letters to more than 10,000 taxpayers who potentially owed back taxes on unreported virtual currency transactions. “I think we're only going to see a step up in enforcement, specifically because of what we're seeing in the decentralized finance world,” Bass said. Noticing that taxpayers still weren’t reporting their digital money moves, the IRS sued crypto exchange Coinbase and partially won to collect user data. The IRS will ask for a slice of your $45,000 proceeds, which is called a capital gain. The IRS published its first official guidance on virtual currency taxability in 2014.</description>

  <title>EU to Discuss Waiving Covid Vaccine Patent Protections</title>

Moderna already said it won't enforce patent rights on its mRNA vaccine, but is willing to license the technology. In this case, a waiver would allow third parties to manufacture and sell the Covid vaccines patented by companies including Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson. And its vaccine uses pretty established technology. Pfizer's CEO opposes a waiver.</description>

  <title>Facebook Bans Trump For Six More Months</title>

The reason social media platforms can go the latter route without fear of being sued by disgruntled users boils down to a piece of legislation: Section 230, which is looking a little weathered 25 years after being introduced. Co-chairman Michael McConnell said Facebook must restore Trump’s account, ban him permanently, or put a time limit on his suspension.</description>

  <title>Facebook Bans Trump For Six More Months</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4980%2Fthumbs_down_facebook.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Facebook handed the Oversight Board the Draw 25 card that is deciding Trump’s ban, and the Oversight Board slapped down a Reverse: It has tasked Facebook with clearing up its convoluted rules around handling prominent users like Trump. The reason social media platforms can go the latter route without fear of being sued by disgruntled users boils down to a piece of legislation: Section 230, which is looking a little weathered 25 years after being introduced.  Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Twitch all indefinitely kicked Trump off their platforms in the weeks following the riots.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/nKux8GJ0lTEMU0jI3d/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Zoom out: Featured in only 50,000 of its 85 million products, diamonds aren’t Pandora’s crown jewel. Price: Man-made diamonds are up to 10x cheaper than mined ones. That hasn’t been proven, but Pandora claims it’ll make its diamonds using only renewable energy by next year.</description>

  <title>Tiger Global Management Is Eating the VC World</title>

During the pandemic, Tiger went on a dealmaking run for the ages that’s culminating in a new $10 billion fund, the largest ever raised by an independent fund manager for minority tech investments. But whereas SoftBank went deep in a few moonshot startups, Tiger is going wide, throwing money at founders before other investors swoop in. What is Tiger? It owned ~10% of Coinbase before its public debut.</description>
