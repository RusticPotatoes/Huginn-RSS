  <title>Will Crypto Rule the World?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5044%2Fcrypto_future.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The world is truly crypto’s oyster. And while we don’t recommend a doge tat, we do recommend boning up on crypto, even knowing how volatile it is. Not only have cryptos checked that box, they’ve become major players in the $$$ world—aka finance.  And you’ve probably heard a thing or two about NFTs, a blockchain-based way to claim exclusive ownership of a piece of art, video clip, GIF, or even a newspaper column. The promise of DeFi is a financial system that’s more efficient, more tech-driven, and—dare we say it? decentralized finance, or DeFi. Why are those people so hyped? The idea of DeFi is pretty revolutionary.</description>

  <title>April Jobs Report Is a Big Whiff for the US Economy</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2R04CaebgtebcxvG/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Skills mismatch: Perhaps the people looking for jobs don’t have the experience necessary to fill the types of jobs that are open.  Whereas economists had forecasted upwards of 1 million jobs added in April...   Covid reasons: Despite a blazing vaccination rollout in the US, many people might still fear getting infected with the virus at work. After the jobs report was released, the US Chamber of Commerce asked lawmakers to end the extra benefits. economists hope this jobs report was just a bizarre one-off, like Michael Jordan playing baseball.</description>

After the jobs report was released, the US Chamber of Commerce asked lawmakers to end the extra benefits. What we do know is that there is no shortage of jobs in certain industries like retail, manufacturing, and construction.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with...Carlos Watson</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4992%2Fcarlos_watson.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Next weekend, you can catch Watson asking more famous people questions at this year’s virtual OZY Fest, but for now, we ask the questions... You’ve interviewed lots of famous people in your career, what’s your favorite question to ask? And I love to ask people what their karaoke song is. I wish someone would always ask me, “What are your favorite books?” I’m looking forward to the sun, more of it. I love to ask people the most interesting thing they've ever learned about love—it's a really good insight especially from people like Wynton Marsalis and Ava DuVernay. What is a question that you wish people would ask you? I'm looking forward to seeing my buddy José at the YMCA. I'm looking forward to playing pickup basketball.</description>

  <title>Meet Jasyn Prolifiq, the Dogecoin Millionaire</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4975%2Fjasyn_prolifiq.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;thedogecoinmillionaire. Prolifiq remains bullish about the crypto, but he’s also preparing a content side hustle for life whether dogecoin goes to the moon or burns up before it reaches orbit.  February 7: By 6:59pm ET dogecoin hit $0.08.   Prolifiq first got into investing a few years ago when he bought his first Tesla stock. In February, Elon Musk said that people should not be putting their life savings into cryptocurrency. April 15: Dogecoin hit $0.29 and Prolifiq became a paper millionaire. Prolifiq said he invested ~$180,000 into the meme stock when it was less than $0.05 on February 5, and on April 15, exactly 69 days later—an important number in the doge community because of... “I’m just a dude,” Jasyn Prolifiq said. May 5: Prolifiq’s holdings rose to $2.7 million when dogecoin hit $0.65, up 13,960.31% YTD and close to its all-time high of $0.69, per CoinDesk. He’s already bought the web domain www.  So what about the guy who did?</description>
