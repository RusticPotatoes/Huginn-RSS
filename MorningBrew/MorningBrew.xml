  <title>Google Employees Form Union in a Rare Silicon Valley Organizing Effort</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/bGn1XMMW3EglSYFNV6/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  But it's not surprising  For years, Google employees have criticized management for their approach to issues including sexual harassment in the workplace, the company's work with the Pentagon, and treatment of contract workers. The rift between Google employees and management continued to escalate Monday, when 226 workers revealed they had formed the Alphabet Workers Union, a reference to Google's parent company. Google discontinued the contract.</description>

  <title>The Pandemic-Era Trends That Will (or Won't) Last</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3562/bucktown_marina_park_host.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Let’s talk about shopping  LIke most Americans, you probably did more of it online this year.   Will virtual tools fully replicate the office experience?   Work from home  Let’s get the obvious out of the way first: There will be a lot more remote workers, maybe triple or quadruple the amount there was before the pandemic, per Mckinsey.   It can save companies lots of money on real estate.   But the pandemic might’ve accelerated a reshuffling of the urban power rankings. So will you suddenly start going back to strip malls once the pandemic is over? It’s not crazy to think coworking companies like WeWork might benefit from the emergence of the two-day-a-week office worker. Plus, in a post-pandemic world, people will be able to work in settings other than their bedrooms, like a coffee shop or a library. What the pandemic did was squeeze 10 years of adoption into just three months, according to McKinsey.   And almost 70% will continue to buy online for in-store pickup.   Probably not. And I’m curious about which aspects of the pandemic lifestyle will outlast the plague.   Finally, the future of cities Here’s why NYC is dea— Just kidding.   Companies are also facing a drastically new landscape in the war for talent.     Toward a framework Is there some kind of “rule” that determines whether a pandemic-inspired trend will stick around after we’ve all gotten our shots?   Up: Mid-tier, cheaper cities like Madison, WI, and Sacramento, CA. The pandemic has forced us to change our behavior in dramatic ways. We’d return to eating $18 salads at our office desks.   But Covid-19 has stuck around for, well, a really long time. For employees, it can be fun; it can also mean three nights at a Holiday Inn in Topeka. Travel publisher Skift made just over $10 million in revenue in 2018...    But “remote work” doesn’t mean “WFH.” And our hands smell vaguely like cheap tequila all the time.</description>

  <title>Looking at The Role Luck Played in Business Success</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/c2pOELjarKcU/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Disney would be in a (small) world of hurt right now had it not launched Disney+ five months before the pandemic.   Novavax: Talk about a business that is boomin. Zoom’s revenue was up 367% from a year ago in Q3; its stock is up nearly 600% this year alone. The lucky ones Zoom: The fact that I’m having trouble coming up with a WFH joke right now shows just how many stories we’ve written about Zoom since March.   The raw end of the deal For every Peloton and Zoom, there were thousands of small businesses forced to close despite having thriving operations before the pandemic.   Peloton: Another company that hit the lotto while being struck by lightning, Peloton has delivered its hardware (bikes, treadmills) to a lot more households this year thanks to the pandemic.   The Fat Radish, an upscale NYC eatery, was forced to close in July because it didn’t have the street space to take advantage of outdoor dining.   But even on a restaurant-by-restaurant basis, some were unluckier than others.   Still, growing pains are good, because it means you’re...   The pandemic has put Zoom in an awkward position, according to Packy McCormick, writer of the Not Boring newsletter.   But as any tipsy trip to the roulette table can tell you, luck is a double-edged sword.   Because of the nature of the lockdowns, restaurants have been particularly unlucky.   Peloton’s ankles are also showing after it outgrew its 2019 pants. And Baby Yoda could likely run for president. But Baby Yoda, Hamilton, and “Let It Go” saved the day. It took an $81 million operating loss in FY 2020 after netting $6.8 billion in profit in FY 2019.</description>

  <title>Meet Brew Writer Toby Howell</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/cl2uMTIF3976dnjEty/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Recommend literally anything: If your computer doth protest too much when you open more than seven tabs, you have to try the OneTab Chrome extension.    One thing you are snobby about: I won’t eat even marginally expired foods. Even though I know milk doesn’t go bad the moment the date on the carton passes, I just can’t make myself ingest something after the approved timeframe for consumption.</description>

  <title>2020 in Review: Coronavirus Explodes Distinctions Between Public and Private Sectors</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/TlK63EEpq1DePsGR0Ag/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  In other words, while 2020 was a year of crisis, it exposed—and perhaps helped us to contemplate—just how intertwined government and business are in non-crisis times.   One University of California Berkeley economist argued that to support testing early on, the government should have inserted itself even more into the private sector by guaranteeing test makers a return on their investments.   Another example? But it has shown us the most extreme forms of government intervention in the private sector.      And now?   Enter 2020.   The Defense Production Act (DPA)  This little-known law allows presidents to give businesses homework in service of imperiled national defense.   Early on, business owners clashed with their elected leaders over social distancing restrictions. In 2020, the government stepped in to a degree not seen before in our lifetimes.   Of course, business has always had to work with the government; 2020 didn’t invent the concept of regulation.   Then there’s the stimulus  In March, the U.S. economy was chugging along with historically low unemployment, then it turned left at a sign marked “coronavirus” and chugged off a cliff. He’s promised to wield the DPA to support healthcare efforts and called for a meaty third stimulus package. Many economists agree the magnitude of the stimulus was beyond warranted, and for many critics, it wasn’t anywhere near enough. Remember this awful graph? But it was.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3543/neal_freyman.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    First R-rated movie: I think it was an 8 Mile + American Pie double-header at a middle school sleepover.    One thing you are snobby about: Bagels.   What you would be doing if not writing for the Brew: A pilot making cargo runs in the Caribbean.   If you could safely eat any inedible object, what would it be? Once I got back to solid ground I called my friends and told them how much I appreciated them.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/1246jjAs7b1Fvi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Christmas tree grower associations have reported that earlier purchases and increased sales this year are sapping inventory (the National Christmas Tree Association says it's not a shortage, just a tight supply).   One explanation: the recession But not the one fresh on your mind.</description>

  <title>Should Apple Make Cars?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3540/apple_car.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The bulls argue that while auto manufacturing takes a lot of cash, Apple is the rare company that has... Also, Apple investors are used to eye-popping growth—to keep its stock price on a roll, Apple needs to pursue new markets.   Tesla CEO Elon Musk seems to be gearing up for a fight.   Zoom out: While we don't have a final verdict on the Apple car, we know it would be a challenge to Tesla.   Root suggested it would be wiser for Apple to pursue the route Alphabet's Waymo has taken: developing self-driving tech to sell to automakers.</description>
