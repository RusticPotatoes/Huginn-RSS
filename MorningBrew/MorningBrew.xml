He tried to force ByteDance, TikTok’s China-based parent company, to sell TikTok to a US company, leading to a Bachelor-esque competition among powerful American corporations to buy the app and access its vast Gen Z consumer base.

For almost three years, criminals used a network of encrypted devices to share the dirty details of their smuggling and money laundering operations. The engineer was working on a new service, Anom, that stripped mobile phones of their normal functions and disguised a secure messaging app to look like a calculator.</description>

  <title>FDA Approves First Alzheimer's Drug to Treat Underlying Cause</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5369%2Flab.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the FDA approved Biogen's aducanumab, the first drug to treat the underlying cause of Alzheimer's (sticky brain plaques) and potentially slow the disease's progression in early stage patients. There's certainly money to be made: Biogen says the treatment, which will be sold under the name “Aduhelm,” will cost $56,000 a year.</description>

  <title>Apple Unveils New Privacy and Work Features at WWDC</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5368%2Fwwdc.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  If Apple loses, the company may have to rewrite the rules of its money-printing App Store. Yesterday, Apple defended itself and said the App Store has paid over $230 billion to developers since opening in 2008. Apple kicked off its annual WWDC conference for developers with a keynote address showing off its new software features. Apple users will be able to block tracking by email senders, a change that could mean big disruptions for businesses that depend on email marketing. And trusted contacts to get you back into iCloud after you forget your new password. Fancier maps.</description>

However, Dr. Peter Marks of the FDA told CNN that vaccinated people likely won’t need a booster shot within a year of receiving their initial doses. Will I need to get a booster shot for Covid?

  <title>G-7 Ministers Agree to Corporate Minimum Tax</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1766%2Fformer_fed_chair_janet_yellen.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Biden administration estimates a global minimum tax system would lead to $500 billion in additional tax revenue for the US over the next decade.  The provision is meant to address European leaders’ concerns that they can’t sufficiently tax tech giants like Facebook and Google, because while those companies make tons of money in Europe, they are based in the US and pay taxes there.   The backstory: Multinational companies have been taking advantage of existing tax rules by shuffling money between jurisdictions with super-low rates.</description>
