Sometimes, you need to spend the most money on one of the smallest pieces of the car: the license plate. A vanity plate with the letter-number combo “P7” sold for $15 million at a charity auction in Dubai last weekend, making it the most expensive license plate in the world.

  <title>Italy temporarily banned ChatGPT over AI concerns</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeYesterday, Italy’s data protection authority temporarily banned ChatGPT—and not because the AI chatbot may have told one user he could slather his pasta in Flamin’ Hot Cheetos salsa. AI chatbots *do* have a lot of data in their trunkThe ban stems from a recent accidental leak of user conversations with ChatGPT. The regulator is primarily concerned that ChatGPT collects and stores Italian users’ personal data without their permission. Determining what data out of that info glut belongs to Italian citizens if necessary would be…complicated. But things could get even thornier if the regulator also decides to delve into the other kind of data the system stores. Not only regulators are concerned about AI’s new-found popularity: More than 1,000 tech leaders and experts signed a controversial open letter this week calling for a six-month pause on sophisticated AI projects. AI systems like ChatGPT make huge sweeps of the internet and feed all that info into their underlying algorithms. —JW</description>

  <title>How does a VC decide to fund a healthcare startup?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/57a4ac1ce1c3b3d08c6f34d94772b7cd71eaddbf-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. For us, even if we’re investing at the seed stage, we still want to be able to dream of how this company could become a huge standalone business. We tend to do analysis through a data room that our founder has put together. The biggest one for us is really just that we want to partner with teams that are trying to build big category-defining companies, and in some cases, that’s not really the desire of the founding team. But it’s a great way to get everyone on the investment team to put their thoughts and their vote down. How many startups do you consider at one time? We try to get back to everyone we hear from, whether it’s a cold email or a referral from someone in our network. Does the process of deciding to invest in a healthcare company look very different than if deciding to invest in a different industry? The first step is meeting a founder, whether it’s in person or virtual. The last step, and this is pretty typical, is a company coming in to present to the full investment team. If they’re raising a certain amount of money, we like to understand the use of proceeds. When you’re looking at a new company and deciding whether or not you would want to invest in it, what’s the first step you take? What’s the last step before you make a decision? It’s different for every company, but the steps we take and the way we think about it is really consistent from industry to industry. Grass walked us through how she decides whether or not to invest in a health startup. How do you evaluate if it’s the right people? And then we really like to understand the fundraise. Where’s that going? But in general, that’s the last step for us. Since 2017, Grass has worked as a venture capitalist in the health tech division of Greycroft, where she’s invested in startups like Boulder Care, Knox, and ScriptDrop. How can we help them think through the forecast and make sure that’s the right amount at the right time? How long on average would you say the process takes from the first cold email to a final decision? We’re trying to understand how big the opportunity size is. Is this the right team to build this company?</description>

  <title>How ‘Tetris’ crossed the Iron Curtain and took over the world</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/4d69c773ce1adb87a83c00eab39526c1a5fc6601-1024x689.jpg?rect=0,3,1024,683&amp;w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. While the movie does add some embellishments, the true story is pretty wild. Stein then shook on a deal with British media tycoon Robert Maxwell (the villain in the Tetris movie and Ghislaine Maxwell’s father in real life) to sell the game for PCs. Maxwell’s company, Mirrorsoft, prepared to distribute Tetris worldwide using exoticized Soviet-themed branding. The negotiations and their outcome resembled a game of legal Tetris:Rogers got the coveted handheld license allowing Nintendo to package Tetris with Game Boy.And Stein walked away oblivious that his new contract with Elorg was sneakily amended to exclude console rights. But there were L-shaped roadblocksWhen the USSR’s technology export authority, known as Elorg, got wind that the Soviet game would be sold internationally, they notified Stein that he never actually got the distribution rights because the Soviet government technically owned the intellectual property— not the game’s creator. The British entrepreneur Robert Stein discussed licensing Tetris for distribution on the other side of the Iron Curtain with Pajitnov and walked away convinced he had the rights. The film chronicles gaming dealmaker Henk Rogers’s trip to late-1980s Moscow to bring the game, created by Soviet programmer Alexey Pajitnov, to Nintendo Game Boy players worldwide. Mirrorsoft also sold the rights to develop the game for home gaming devices and coin-operated machines to Atari before officially securing them. He bought the PC rights for Japan, and gaming behemoth Nintendo became eager to license it for its forthcoming handheld device: Game Boy. So Rogers set out to make it happen, reportedly putting his life savings on the line. —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!</description>

The one thing that I’ve learned from the past couple years is that universally everyone loves to see their name written, especially if someone else took the time to write it. I keep it manicured, especially if I’m doing calligraphy in person. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. Do people ever not realize your work is calligraphy at first and think it’s just printed out? What’s one thing that someone who doesn’t do calligraphy professionally wouldn’t know? One of my first projects was a man who contacted me because he actually had lost some mobility in his arm, so he had a hard time writing. Calligraphy can look so perfect. So, especially with day-to-day phone and computer usage, I try to make sure that I take extra good care of my right hand. It’s really a case-by-case basis.</description>
