  <title>What's the Hype Around Air Fryers?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4440%2Fair_fryer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A few years later, van der Weij licensed the tech to Philips, which debuted the first modern air fryer at a consumer electronics show in Berlin in 2010.  But what is an air fryer? But here’s where the genius of van der Weij comes in: Air fryers get your food nice and crispy without the oil bath. The recommendation site Wirecutter put the air fryer on its “Worst Things for Most People” list. Basically, an air fryer pummels your food with hot air circulated by a high-speed fan. The pandemic, and the millions of new home chefs it spawned, may have anointed the air fryer kitchen royalty. You encounter the Maillard reaction when you eat all kinds of delicious foods, including campfire-roasted marshmallows, seared steaks, and french fries.</description>

Goldman Sachs bankers have become a little too familiar with their Zoom reflection. In the market, over 400 SPACs with $131 billion in cash are looking for companies to merge with. It's advised 32 SPACs in Q1 for $9.2 billion in proceeds, according to Refinitiv data. Only Citigroup's got it beat with 56 SPAC IPOs for $10.5 billion. And the SEC recently warned investors to treat celebrities' SPACs with the same skepticism as their Proactiv commercials.</description>

It's advised 32 SPACs in Q1 for $9.2 billion in proceeds, according to Refinitiv data. Goldman Sachs bankers have become a little too familiar with their Zoom reflection. In the market, over 400 SPACs with $131 billion in cash are looking for companies to merge with.  Zoom out: As SPACs continue to IPO with huge valuations, analysts are still worried about market "indigestion." And the SEC recently warned investors to treat celebrities' SPACs with the same skepticism as their Proactiv commercials.</description>

  <title>Fed Boosts Economic Growth Projections, but Maintains Its Easy Money Strategy</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4421%2Ffederal_reserve_chair_jer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Fed said things do look better, then it’s increasingly hard to justify its current strategy of ultra-loose monetary policy, which is when the Fed uses its tools (like lowering interest rates) to juice the economy when it’s in the dumps. That’s not us trying to impress our middle school readers—it’s a direct quote from the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy statement yesterday.   As the US economy continues to rebound from its Covid-induced recession, the Fed projects GDP will grow 6.5% this year, a big jump from its previous estimate of 4.2% in December.</description>
