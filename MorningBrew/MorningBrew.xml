  <title>What's Up With the Child Tax Credit?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5777%2Firs_building.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Taxpayers who claimed the child tax credit on their 2020 returns—or 2019 for those who haven’t yet filed for 2020—should be all set to receive monthly payments. The monthly max payment is $300 per child under 6 and $250 per child between ages 6 and 17. Until then, chat up a tax pro if:Your income increased significantly in 2021You’re concerned about a higher-than-usual tax bill next yearYou take turns with someone in claiming the child tax creditYour child turns 6 or 18 in 2021You’re too late to unenroll from the first payment, but you can discontinue the rest here. Parents who aren’t required to file taxes can sign up for payments on the non-filer portal. You’ll get the max payment when your AGI is below... You’ll get something when your AGI is below:$240,000 and you’re single$440,000 and you’re married filing jointly$240,000 and you’re a head of householdYou can calculate exactly how much you’ll get here. The IRS is looking back at your most recent return to calculate your monthly payment, but the actual tax credit amount is based on your 2021 situation. They’ll get the other half when they file their 2021 taxes next year.</description>

  <title>With the US Fully Open for Business, Inflation Hits Highest Rate in 13 Years</title>

Prices that are booming thanks to supply shortages. Prices that will remain higher permanently. As always with inflation stories, we must close by turning to the Fed, whose main job is to keep prices stable. As we mentioned, the bulk of the price increases were in sectors battered by the pandemic (hospitality) or those battling supply shortages (used cars). Prices that plummeted early in the pandemic and are surging to catch up.</description>

  <title>With the US Fully Open for Business, Inflation Hits Highest Rate in 13 Years</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5756%2Finflation_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Used cars are the star of this category, with their price increases accounting for more than a third of June’s total price hikes. Prices that are booming thanks to supply shortages. Prices that will remain higher permanently. Prices that plummeted early in the pandemic and are surging to catch up.

Experts warn that the number of deaths could soon rise in unvaccinated areas of the country, but for now they’re down 27% nationwide from two weeks ago. In the US, which is more or less fully reopened for business, cases rose 47% last week, the biggest increase since April 2020.</description>
