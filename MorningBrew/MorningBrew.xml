  <title>U.S. Labels Vietnam, Switzerland Currency Manipulators</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lptjRBxFKCJmFoibP3/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury labeled the European country and Vietnam currency manipulators. It’s when governments try to tilt the winds of trade in their favor by illegally tinkering with their currency. But the Swiss government doesn't want it to rise too much.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriffhhxhmuQP2Xgk/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The suit claims that Google is the Joey Chestnut to the digital advertising industry's plate of hotdogs.   Yesterday, a group of state attorneys general led by Texas said they're taking legal action against Google for, you guessed it, engaging in anticompetitive practices.</description>

  <title>Brew’s Bookshelf: Holiday Gift Guide</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3447/holiday_books.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Henry Stockwell, copywriter: E: A Novel by Matt Beaumont This novel is really just a collection of fake emails from a fictional London ad agency at the start of the 21st century, when I guess ad agencies still operated somewhat like Mad Men?   Milo Booke, product manager: One Billion Americans by Matthew Yglesias  Yglesias lays out a vision of an America that reorients its policies and culture toward growing our population massively, giving us more economic and diplomatic heft and influence in a world of other ascendant global powers.   Mainly, this book takes anime seriously as a “media success story,” just as companies like Netflix are starting to do.   Eliza Carter, daily newsletter writer: Billion Dollar Loser by Reeves Wiedeman  You know the rise and fall of WeWork was nuts. If you’re a movie buff, this is a must read. Hayden Field, Emerging Tech Brew writer: Uncanny Valley by Anna Wiener  A beautifully-written memoir about the author’s move from the New York publishing industry to the Silicon Valley tech world. This is the main question asked throughout the book and I believe that it guides the reader to find that answer. Buy it here. How much of it is what we really know and want versus what’s taught to us?   Kate Noel, VP &amp; head of people ops: Untamed by Glennon Doyle  A memoir that really peels back the layers of what it means to be a woman, mother, and friend in today’s society. But this up-close account from NYMag reporter Reeves Wiedeman reveals the nuttery to be even nuttier than you imagined.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett, David Solomon Urge Congress to Extend PPP for Small Businesses</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3431/warren_buffett.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  PPP has been criticized for fraud and not actually going to small businesses. It's a $525 billion government program intended to help small businesses keep workers on payroll. In an interview with CNBC yesterday morning, legendary investor Warren Buffett urged Congress to pass legislation to help small businesses stay afloat. Help could be on the way if Congress gets the job done.   A real-world example: This summer, American Airlines was able to raise $2.5 billion from selling bonds even as it was bleeding $58 million/day.</description>

  <title>Christmas Markets Need a Christmas Miracle</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3429/santa_claus.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The situation is even tougher for vendors at San Francisco's Dickens Fair, which is a historic market that requires vendors to meet certain standards of "authenticity." His experience implementing health and safety protocols at the flea market helped him open the holiday market in-person safely. Michael Berman, who created the market 16 years ago, also runs D.C.'s Eastern Market and had to adapt this spring to pandemic-era guidelines. While the Christkindlmarket in Chicago is showcasing about 50 exhibitors online (close to the number it welcomed at its in-person market), most are "hanging on for dear life," according to Kate Bleeker, director of expansion and market development.   Vendors need help Small businesses that sell at markets often depend on a handful of in-person events for the majority of their annual sales. In San Francisco, the Great Dickens Christmas Fair also canceled its in-person market and set up the Dickens Fair at Home with an online shop and virtual experiences.   At Bryant Park, foot traffic and sales are estimated at a third of previous years’ levels, and Vagianos said vendors are worried."    But this year, the markets in D.C., San Francisco, and NYC currently have anywhere from a third to half the typical number of vendors exhibiting.   After watching in-person events get postponed the start of the pandemic and reconstitute on Zoom over the summer, Christmas markets began having tough conversations—and we're not talking about the final design for the collectible 2020 candle holder.   Other markets decided to open...</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/hun4DFmfnDId3lid5b/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hack was first identified last week by FireEye, a cybersecurity company that itself was hacked.   As for the identity of the hackers, multiple outlets say all signs point to a specific group of Russian state-backed hackers called “APT29” or “Cozy Bear.”</description>

It's expected to get approval. The remaining challenges Spoilage: Pfizer's vaccine needs to maintain -94°F, and although the company has equipped shipping containers with dry ice and GPS-enabled temperature sensors, it's expected that some doses won't survive the journey.  </description>

  <title>Your Candy Bar Has a Dark Secret</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3391/chocolate.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Originally filed in 2005, the case alleges the companies violated international laws against child slavery." Nestlé and Cargill say they've made efforts to eliminate child labor from supply chains. The chocolate supply chain is riddled with child labor.    That's one of the problems with the cocoa supply chain.   An October report from the Labor Department estimates ~1.6 million children are working on cocoa farms. A decision on the side of Nestlé and Cargill could affect future human rights cases brought under the ATS.    This case could have big implications for corporate liability The case centers on the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), a provision nearly as old as the U.S. that provides a path for foreign nationals to sue over violations of international law or U.S. treaties abroad in American courts.   This wasn't the Court's first dance with ATS.   They won't have to worry...   Ex.: The ATS has been invoked in conversations around corporate liability for supply chains linked to imprisoned Uighur Muslims in China."   While the justices weren't convinced that ATS was the right statute to use in pursuit of this case...</description>

  <title>The Popping IPO Market Could Be “Broken”</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/31q2ecYvWjcYsWthyQ/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2019, just three newly public companies did.   For Chesky, the gap between Airbnb’s debut share price of $68 and the $139/share it actually opened at translates to billions of dollars of missed opportunity (had the company initially sold its shares at that higher price). Plus, these first-day pops can make shares look soggy later.</description>

  <title>Finance Bosses Look Beyond Wall Street to Florida</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7TKT7gSMOT8Thtss/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Yesterday, Ken Moelis, the chairman and CEO of New York investment bank Moelis &amp; Co., told Bloomberg he wouldn't stop his employees from moving to Florida.   It’s not just finance… And it’s not just New York bleeding business leaders. And if that talent wants to do it in Florida, that’s where we’ll support them.”   Right on cue, software giant Oracle said yesterday it was moving its HQ from Redwood City, CA, to Austin, TX.   It’s not exactly a secret that Florida is warmer than New York, boasts a cheaper cost of living, and has world-class institutions like Publix.     Why now?</description>
