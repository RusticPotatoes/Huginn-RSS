  <title>Biden Calls Pushes Auto Industry Toward Electrification</title>

Biden’s goal is to cut emissions by 50% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade, and to do that he’s targeting transportation, the industry accounting for 29% of all US emissions.</description>

Meat supplier Tyson will require all of its 120,000 US workers to be vaccinated. That divide’s best illustrated by Walmart, where only corporate workers need to show proof of vaccination.</description>

  <title>SEC Chief Gary Gensler Calls Crypto the "Wild West" in Speech</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6077%2Fsenate_holds_hearing_on_r.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To clean things up, Gensler asked Congress for more resources to police the crypto world, such as the authority to monitor crypto exchanges.  Regulation should be welcome in crypto, Gensler said, because it sets guardrails and can pave the way for success. The market is worth about $1.6 trillion, Gensler said. Why does it matter what Gensler thinks?  But here’s something you may not know: Gensler is kind of a crypto nerd himself.  As the country’s top financial regulator, he could hand down the most significant rules for the crypto industry to date.</description>

  <title>SEC Chief Gary Gensler Calls Crypto the "Wild West" in Speech</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6077%2Fsenate_holds_hearing_on_r.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; To clean things up, Gensler asked Congress for more resources to police the crypto world, such as the authority to monitor crypto exchanges. The market is worth about $1.6 trillion, Gensler said.  But here’s something you may not know: Gensler is kind of a crypto nerd himself. Why does it matter what Gensler thinks?  As the country’s top financial regulator, he could hand down the most significant rules for the crypto industry to date.  Regulation should be welcome in crypto, Gensler said, because it sets guardrails and can pave the way for success.</description>

  <title>So You Wanna Be a Cryptonaire</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6075%2Fcryptocurrency_wallet.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Only 14% of people in the US have crypto investments, according to crypto exchange Gemini, and the market is still a pea compared to the global stock and bond markets.   Cryptocurrency isn’t just bitcoin. If you want to invest in crypto or other assets, that’s fine and dandy. But if you’re looking to diversify your portfolio and put some money in a new asset class, do some research and try starting small. The bear case: There’s a lot of speculation happening in the crypto market, and while some cryptocurrencies post huge gains, they can also be incredibly volatile. which you should already have after setting your initial investment and retirement strategy. If you sell a crypto asset, use it to purchase goods/services, or trade it for another cryptocurrency, any profit you make is probably subject to a capital gains tax (which varies based on how long the asset is held).  Just please don’t put your life savings in dogecoin. Cryptocurrency can be the bulk of those riskier investments or just a slice—but it shouldn’t be the majority of your portfolio. For crypto novices, numerous financial advisors recommend starting off with a very small allocation (1%–2%) of your portfolio in crypto. The IRS taxes cryptocurrency transactions similarly to property.   Bottom line: Unlike pairing black socks with brown loafers, there isn’t a correct answer about whether you should invest in crypto today.</description>

  <title>Health Officials Say Vulnerable Americans May Need Vaccine Booster Shots</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/FRkBbAdRf2jTfahZaA/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It plans to ask for regulatory approval in the US for a booster shot this month.   We should note: Gottlieb is on the Pfizer board.   There's no clear roadmap, but momentum is building to offer some Americans a booster shot.  Britain will begin offering a booster of a Covid vaccine starting in September, the Telegraph reported. Bahrain is giving Pfizer boosters to some people who received China’s Sinopharm vaccine. Pfizer suggested a third shot would help bolster immunity in vulnerable populations as the Delta variant spreads.  Other governments have made similar moves:Israel began giving a booster shot to people over 60 this past weekend.</description>

We should note: Gottlieb is on the Pfizer board. Bahrain is giving Pfizer boosters to some people who received China’s Sinopharm vaccine.   Just like the CDC made a U-turn on mask policies last week, US health officials have reversed their tone from a few weeks ago by saying vulnerable Americans may need booster shots.  Former FDA Chief Scott Gottlieb told CNBC, “My guess is sometime by September or October we will be giving booster shots to older individuals and certainly immunocompromised.”  </description>

  <title>It’s time to care about cryptocurrency</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4404%2Fbitcoin_magic.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to a 2021 report assessing crypto adoption in the US, 14% of the population owns cryptocurrency—and though today’s average crypto investor is exactly the stereotype your mind might conjure (late thirties, male, annual income north of $100k), tomorrow’s is more likely to be older, less wealthy, and a woman.  The price of a bitcoin as of this writing? Of course, not all of us can be as well-read as my ride-hailing friend from 2014. The price of bitcoin was about $500 or $600 back then, and most of the news headlines about cryptocurrency centered on two things: one, that crypto was used to acquire illegal goods on the black market, and two, that its value was volatile enough to vaporize a nest egg overnight—with ample evidence to back that up. He clearly had most of us beat. If sheer value isn’t justification enough to take crypto seriously, look no further than El Salvador, whose legislature in June made bitcoin legal tender in the Central American nation. In other words: It’s finally time for you, a regular person, to get educated on crypto. I’m in the backseat of an Uber, or maybe it’s a Lyft, I dunno.   But the traffic is bad to SFO and we’ve got time to kill.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjI4MMUuv9TZwXCM/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Companies that enjoyed a surge in sales during the worst of the pandemic last year are confronting a new era of more socializing with people, and less socializing with an imaginary paper towel friend.    Pinterest stock plunged 18% Friday after reporting a 5% decline in global users last quarter.  Amazon, a poster child for the Covid boom, fell 7.6% Friday for their worst day in more than a year, dropping Jeff Bezos below French luxury mogul Bernard Arnault on the list of world’s richest people.</description>
