Scott acknowledged wealth disparities in a Medium post announcing her donations yesterday, writing, "It would be better if disproportionate wealth were not concentrated in a small number of hands, and that the solutions are best designed and implemented by others." Yesterday, MacKenzie Scott announced she donated $2.7 billion to 286 organizations working to address issues including poverty, racial equity, and higher education.</description>

  <title>Lumber Prices Post Biggest Weekly Loss Ever</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4744%2Flumber_prices.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Is higher-priced lumber the new normal? For context: Since the early '90s, lumber futures have mostly traded between $200 and $600. Strong demand will probably keep lumber prices above pre-pandemic levels for at least 1–2 years, according to BMO analyst Mark Wilde.</description>

  <title>CEO and CFO of Electric Vehicle Maker Lordstown Motors Resign</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5444%2Flordstown_motors.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Hindenburg investigation also led to the departure of executive chairman Trevor Milton at Nikola, another electric truck startup that went public via SPAC.  Last year, Steve Burns, founder and now the former CEO, helped drive the company public via SPAC, one of many electric automakers to go public by merging with a blank-check company. The Ford F-150 frunk might be as good as it’s going to get for electric trucks this year. Lordstown stock climbed more than 200% last summer.</description>

Nintendo could use tomorrow's announcement reel to finally unveil a new-and-improved Nintendo Switch.</description>

  <title>MLB Expected to Address Sticky Stuff Controversy in Coming Days</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1193%2Fbaseball_stadium.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitchers themselves aren't exactly pushing back. Well, the advantage pitchers gain from the sticky stuff may be contributing to one of the most pitiful batting displays in baseball's long history. Boosting offenses and maintaining what’s left of MLB’s integrity is critical to the long-term success of the league.</description>

  <title>MLB Expected to Address Sticky Stuff Controversy in Coming Days</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1193%2Fbaseball_stadium.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pitchers themselves aren't exactly pushing back. Well, the advantage pitchers gain from the sticky stuff may be contributing to one of the most pitiful batting displays in baseball's long history. Boosting offenses and maintaining what’s left of MLB’s integrity is critical to the long-term success of the league.</description>

E3 has been losing exhibitors and, some argue, relevance ever since its ’00s heyday when, for instance, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr went on stage to promote The Beatles: Rock Band. ? A coincidence or... Nintendo could use tomorrow's announcement reel to finally unveil a new-and-improved Nintendo Switch.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Balancing Work and Life</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021.  —Lily I find I am constantly overworked and lack a proper work life balance. How do I find my work-life balance at this company? You need to start setting expectations for yourself and for your coworkers that some parts of the day are off-limits for work matters. Comp questions can be really hard to navigate! The safest bet is to provide a salary range that would work for you.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: What If I Have Shares in a Non-Public Company?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4692%2Fbudget_scale.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It’s way easier to sell your shares if and when your company goes public or is acquired by another company. There are eBay-like marketplaces for selling private company shares, but it’s not like posting a picture of your old iPod and offering free shipping.  If you want to sell your stake before the company goes public, you can ask the execs at your company to buy back your shares.</description>

  <title>Didi Chuxing Leads, What Could Be, a Record Breaking IPO Summer</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/ocIqPZAlNdyko/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Thursday, Didi Chuxing, China’s largest ride-hailing service, filed for a US IPO at a reported $70 billion valuation. Bankers are forecasting that US-listed IPOs could raise up to $40 billion from June through August this year, topping last year’s record of $32 billion, per the WSJ.</description>

  <title>House Lawmakers Drop Five Antitrust Bills on Big Tech</title>

Mergers: A fourth bill would make it more difficult for Big Tech companies to snatch up smaller competitors. Conflict of interest: Huge tech companies wouldn't be able to own or operate a business that would incentive it to favor its own products over those of a competitor.  Those new lawsHere’s a quick look at the major themes of the five bills lawmakers dropped yesterday.</description>

  <title>The Boring Company Says "Open Sesame"</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5415%2Fboring_company.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And the now-operational Las Vegas Loop is proof that, at least to an extent, he is capable of turning stuck-in-traffic musings into reality, even if it is "basically just Teslas in tunnels at this point," as Musk himself admitted. The Boring Company's Loop in Las Vegas can transport up to 4,400 passengers per hour. Skeptics question why Musk is digging tunnels to shuttle people around... And it can ferry a lot more people than the Boring Company's system currently can.  In all, it was a rather, uh, boring debut for The Boring Company, a venture Musk created after he became fed up with LA gridlock."</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with… Insecure's Yvonne Orji</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5411%2Fyvonne_orji.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Before I went in to pitch my show for Oprah, back in 2015, my roommate was like, "Do you have a hype song?" It's unclear what people talked about in group chats before Insecure graced us with its hilarious plotlines, juicy drama, and, of course, Emmy-nominated Yvonne Orji. I would love to be in my car, feeling down, and then look up and see a billboard that says "Why not me?" If you could write anything on a billboard, what would it be?" I was like, if this older white man and this older white woman can sell gazillions of books [by] pretty much talking about faith, why not me? Why not me?</description>
