  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4730%2Fbernie_madoff.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madoff orchestrated the biggest investment fraud in US history, costing his investors a total of $64.8 billion and earning him a 150-year prison sentence.

  <title>How Forbes 30 Under 30’s Phillip Aubrey Does His Taxes </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4729%2Fphillip_aubrey.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; MB: Can you tell us one do or don’t?  PA: A lot of people, especially on the startup side, tend to think whatever money they raise they can use all willy nilly.  MB: Before we bring it back to taxes, what’s one thing you learned while working with Alexis? Then we swapped cards so no one had their own, and anyone who wanted to take money out of their account had to go back to the group and ask the group to release their funds.    PA: QuickBooks makes it very easy for us to categorize expenses, so when we hand things over to our accountant, it’s not difficult to understand where money went and is going.  MB: What’s tough about it?  MB: I know this is supposed to be a tax interview but I have to ask, you were working for Alexis Ohanian’s Initialized Capital before you left to run Yunit full-time.  PA: Even being able to answer some of the questions that our tax professional is asking to make sure they’re doing the paperwork correctly. Over a two-year period, not one person took money out of their account. The biggest benefit is we can very easily share ownership or sell shares of the company, whereas most other incorporation types don’t make that easy. The next stage is to make the app publicly available and allow people to start their own savings groups. He discussed the importance of keeping personal and business money separate, the power of using community to reach your financial goals, and the ups and downs of creating the world he wants to see.  PA: Alexis is a dreamer, and I love it. For example, keeping personal money separate from business money.  PA: My goal was to go out and raise venture money because I knew that I wanted to scale the business, and 99% of venture-backed businesses are a Delaware C-corp, which we are as well.  PA: It came a few years ago, when a partner was fired at a company where I worked.  PA: We are doing our private beta now, which is very exciting because I’m getting some great feedback. It shocked me because I didn’t know at the time that partners could be fired. And yet, no one was managing their money well.  MB: So how is Yunit structured as a business, and why did you decide to incorporate that way? So I reached out to that same person and asked him to help us out with our taxes.  Phillip Aubrey: Yunit is a mobile app that makes it easy for friends and family to save money together. You learn quickly what you can and cannot do.</description>

  <title>Q&amp;A: What Are Company Earnings, Why do They Affect Stocks?</title>

But an earnings report can also show metrics like revenue, subscriber counts (in the case of companies like Netflix), and predictions for future performance, aka "guidance." Then, execs usually host a conference call to parse the data in front of analysts and whichever media interns drew the short stick."</description>

  <title>Consumer Prices Rise More Than Expected in March</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4715%2Fgas_pump_with_dollar_bills.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US consumer prices increased the most in nearly nine years in March: 0.6% over the prior month and 2.6% over last year. Some economists are concerned that too much stimulus will cause an overheated economy.   Looking ahead…the Fed expects a temporary bump in prices that will smooth out once supply chains figure their Suez out.</description>

  <title>Microsoft to Buy Speech Tech Company Nuance for $16B</title>

The Nuance acquisition could catapult it ahead. er, nuance of human language.</description>
