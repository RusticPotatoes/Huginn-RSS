  <title>Four Tips and Tricks to Better B2B Ads</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4866%2Fbranding_masters.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Avoid Coming Off Like a Jargon Junkie Biz and brand jargon are like a ghost pepper hot sauce—a little can go a long way.  That being said, we firmly believe that a niche jargon-plug used in an unexpected way can be just the thing you need to get that giggle and drive engagement.  AKA: make sure your brand reaches your target audience where they spend the most time.  Make sure you’re using places like your website and LinkedIn to establish who you are and allow you to iterate on your branding as things change.  On LinkedIn, for example, you can combine multiple criteria to create sophisticated targeting and use video or Led Gen Form retargeting to make your marketing pop—just saying. But as too many people know (not us, we’re perfect) ads often stand out in a not so good way.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with... Cameo CEO Steven Galanis</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4838%2Fsteven_galanis.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I collect a lot now—this even predates Cameo and I think it's one of the reasons I got into it. You started Cameo while still working at LinkedIn. What was the "aha" moment when you knew you were ready to go full-time?  I think people can blow up on Cameo and become sensations there. My brain chemistry changed that day, and I just knew I had to go and pursue this. So I would probably love to be one of the 300 Spartans that fought. I don't think we can take you from zero to one, but I think we could take you from one to 10. If you could live in the setting of any book or movie, what would it be? I grew up as a hockey player.  And the answer was no.</description>

  <title>Italian Man Skips Work for 15 Years, Still Gets Paid</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2YWrtthgz6PzBmFi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Scumace could face charges of abuse of office, forgery, and aggravated extortion, but he’ll go down in Italian history as the “king of absentees.” Slacking off as a public sector worker is a rampant-enough problem in Italy that Italians call perpetrators a name that roughly translates to “timecard weasels.”</description>
