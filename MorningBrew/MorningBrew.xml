  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l46C5r7CiQN5ox7MI/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;could Tesla stock become... Tesla is not an ordinary stock For one, it’s absolutely humongous. With a market capitalization of $659 billion, Tesla will be the largest company to ever enter the S&amp;P 500.   More than $4.5 trillion is managed by index funds that track the S&amp;P 500. Today, electric automaker Tesla will join the U.S. stock market’s equivalent of Top 40 radio: the S&amp;P 500 index. What does it mean for the stock market?   Second, the stock is extremely volatile, meaning it’s prone to dramatic daily swings based on company news that might not be a huge deal.</description>

  <title>Morning Brew Readers Share Their Quarantine Dating Stories</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/x28cIQSn19Tbi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some made us laugh, some made us cry, and others made us go, “Hmm, didn’t know masks could be used for that.” And because we just met, neither one of us wanted to end the date because we had to pee. To spice things up I said my favorite drink was Mountain Dew... “Did a virtual date for the first time. The call ended about 5 minutes later when I told her I can't date a liar.” she didn't bat an eye and proceeded to tell me she doesn't really drink soda.

  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/RK5LYiBbWw1HuBCxq7/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Okay, maybe the pandemic and accompanying recession are a better explanation. The Covid-19 baby bust won't only “doesn't only depress overall productivity, but it also puts a burden on social insurance systems,” Brookings Senior Fellow Melissa Kearney told Business Casual. At the macro level, this could skew the future workforce toward older people.</description>

That’s because bitcoin isn’t being used as an intermediary to move capital into other “shitcoins.”       Searches for keyword "Bitcoin" via Google Trends Zoom out: A look at Google search data indicates interest by individual investors is far lower than  it was in 2017.   Investors have wisened up on altcoins Rewind to 2017.
