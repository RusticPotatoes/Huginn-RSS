  <title>Batteries Are a Solid Opportunity for EVs</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7311%2Fev_battery.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ford and BMW have partnered with another solid-state battery startup, Solid Power.  Why it matters: EV batteries are a key arena as automakers compete to make cheaper and more durable electric and hybrid vehicles. Besides Toyota, other automakers have also made bids on advanced battery tech: Volkswagen invested in the Bill Gates-backed battery startup QuantumScape.</description>

  <title>Longer Waits, Safer Planes: How 9/11 Changed Air Travel</title>

Only in November 2001 did the government create the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to handle security at airports.</description>

  <title>El Salvador’s Grand Bitcoin Experiment</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7300%2Fel_salvador-economy-crypt.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Welcome to El Salvador, where the pupusas are warm and the bitcoin is tender. Bukele also thinks that, by being an early adopter, the country could become a destination for foreign investment in bitcoin mining.  One-quarter of El Salvador’s GDP comes from remittances—money sent back to the country from people working abroad. Today, the Central American nation will become the first sovereign state to make bitcoin “legal tender,” meaning it’s now an official currency alongside the US dollar.</description>

  <title>For the Defense Industry, 9/11 Changed Everything</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7294%2Fa_us_army_drone.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line: US military spending as a share of GDP has shrunk since peaking in 2011, but the booming homeland security industry it helped create remains a permanent fixture of the economy. Before September 11, 2001, the US had been cutting military spending. Military spending doubled to $700 billion in the decade following 9/11, to about 20% of total government spending.   Did you know?</description>

  <title>US Winds Down Massive, Controversial Unemployment Benefits Program</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F867%2Fusa.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The backstory: In March 2020, as the US was shedding almost 1 million jobs per day, Congress authorized an extra $600/week in unemployment benefits on top of what states offered to keep jobless Americans afloat (the $600/week was later reduced to $300 in August 2020).  In all, the US government has spent $680 billion on unemployment benefits since last March, the second-highest amount among Covid stimulus programs behind only the Paycheck Protection Program ($835 billion). Around the same time, the government also expanded the number of workers eligible for unemployment insurance (UI) by including people like gig workers and the self-employed.</description>

  <title>For the Defense Industry, 9/11 Changed Everything</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7294%2Fa_us_army_drone.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line: US military spending as a share of GDP has shrunk since peaking in 2011, but the booming homeland security industry it helped create remains a permanent fixture of the economy. Before September 11, 2001, the US had been cutting military spending. Military spending doubled to $700 billion in the decade following 9/11, to about 20% of total government spending.</description>

Hiring was expected to fall from the 1.1 million jobs added in July and 962,000 in June, but nowhere near this much. In total, there are 5.6 million fewer workers holding jobs in the US now than before the pandemic hit.  Leisure and hospitality, a sector that falters when Covid anxieties are higher, reported no job increases last month.</description>

  <title>What Does it Mean if QR Codes Are Here to Stay?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7290%2Fqr_code.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So, given that QR codes are likely not a pandemic fad and will be distracting us in restaurants for years to come, what are the implications? And half of all full-service restaurants in the US have opted for QR code menus since the beginning of the pandemic, per the National Restaurant Association. The ease of creating a QR code is one of the reasons why it’s so accessible for businesses, but it also increases opportunities for fraud. While it might seem like you’re just harmlessly ordering a Denny’s Grand Slam® after a long day, QR codes track when, where, and how often you scan them. Looks like it’s 2011 again: the cool kids are dressing like they’re in Gossip Girl, everyone’s talking about a Kanye album, and QR codes are trying to make it big. The Better Business Bureau even issued a warning this summer around fraudulent QR codes.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with...Master Sommelier Ian Cauble</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F7288%2Fian_cauble.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But most people don't have that bottle of wine you found on that shelf in that specific wine shop. With just a 5% pass rate, the top wine test has snarled the dreams of all but 267 people who are able to call themselves a true Master. In 2012, Ian Cauble passed the wine world’s version of astronaut training to become one of only a few Master Sommeliers in the world. Why is wine the go-to dinner party gift? Most people start by working in restaurants for a very long time—a lot of them for more than 10 years by the time they pass the Master Sommelier exam. It’s a very easy gift and there's usually a great story behind it. I would say most wine is not designed to age.</description>
