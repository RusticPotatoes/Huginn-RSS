  <title>Icebreakers With...Bridget Connelly</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4757%2Fbridget_connelly.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I was recently thinking about rereading it.   Luna Bay was "born in Chicago" and is the first woman-founded-and-led hard kombucha brand on the market. So I love making a ginger lemon mezcal Booch-a-Rita. What's your favorite flavor of Luna Bay? What song would you say describes Luna Bay? We are really fortunate that we have amazing distributors that are empowering us and really want to support [women-led] brands. It wasn't until she found herself in San Diego, a hub for hard kombucha and craft beer, that she had the idea to start Luna Bay Booch and enlisted her business partner and childhood friend, Claire Ridge, to help. At first, I would take that personally because I did sign up for this.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Chasing Down Receipts </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I would also assume that before you can take a single day off you would have to make that request to your manager. Your manager has to make a judgment every time a direct report makes a PTO request. When an employee requests time off, the request must always honor the company's general PTO policy. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021. —AnonymousI don't think that you "should" feel guilty about requesting time off with just three months under your belt.</description>

  <title>Should the Government Have Paused the J&amp;J Vaccine?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3759%2Fvaccine_clock.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Finally, US health regulators, by seeking to avoid a credibility crisis, may have just invited one in.    On Monday, the CDC and FDA recommended pausing Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose Covid vaccine while they investigate reports of rare blood clots.  A YouGov poll found that the perception of safety of the J&amp;J vaccine dropped 15 percentage points after officials suspended it.  Instilling confidence in vaccines is their No. 1 priority, and right now... 538's Nate Silver, one of the top critics of the government's decision, suggested that regulators could have said they're monitoring the situation and not paused vaccinations, or could have stopped giving J&amp;J to young women, who appear to be most at risk of developing the rare blood clots.  The argument against a pauseAgencies said they paused the rollout out of an "abundance of caution."</description>

  <title>Traditional IPO vs SPAC: Everything You Need to Know About Taking Your Company Public</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F931%2Fstock_exchange.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a company to go public via a SPAC, a SPAC has to want to take that company public. But with 400+ SPACs strolling around with a box of donuts begging new companies to join them for a “new kind of worship,” companies have a lot of opportunities to, um, SPAC it up. Coinbase, the crypto exchange, used a direct listing to go public Wednesday. A reverse merger is when a private company merges with any public company—it doesn’t have to be a shell company—and goes public in the process. A SPAC raises money through the IPO process, and then merges with a private company and takes it public. In a Dutch auction, the company decides the number of shares, but not how much they will cost.  Why would a company want to go public in the first place? A SPAC is formed before it even knows what it wants to do with its life. A private company goes public without any of the underwriting hullabaloo. SPACs might feel like a hot new craze, but they aren’t new. Reverse mergers were popular in the ’80s for pretty much the same reason SPACs are popular right now, but the SEC cracked down in 2011 when it issued a fraud warning about reverse mergers and suspended trading for more than 800 companies. There are other ways to take your company public. But have no fear, someone somewhere will come up with something new... In a direct listing, the company goes public by bypassing investment banks that buy up a lot of initial shares and decide its opening price. They have become increasingly popular because they help companies go public a lot quicker (a few weeks to months) and less time = fewer fees.</description>

  <title>Coinbase Goes Public in Landmark Moment for Crypto</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4733%2Fcoinbase_going_public.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And like bitcoin, Coinbase is in many ways nontraditional. Coinbase will look to transition more of its client base from freshman pledges to institutional investors.  As the price of bitcoin shot up, so did Coinbase’s fortunes. Here’s why:It’s the first major crypto company to go public in the US. Yesterday, Coinbase, a cryptocurrency exchange, went public on the Nasdaq, a stock exchange. With a valuation of around $86 billion when trading closed yesterday, it’s bigger than exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4730%2Fbernie_madoff.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Madoff orchestrated the biggest investment fraud in US history, costing his investors a total of $64.8 billion and earning him a 150-year prison sentence. Zoom out: While Madoff claimed he was the sole organizer, more than a dozen people, including his brother Peter Madoff, were convicted of federal crimes.  At 22, Madoff started his investment company in 1960.</description>

  <title>How Forbes 30 Under 30’s Phillip Aubrey Does His Taxes </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4729%2Fphillip_aubrey.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; MB: Can you tell us one do or don’t?  PA: A lot of people, especially on the startup side, tend to think whatever money they raise they can use all willy nilly.  MB: Before we bring it back to taxes, what’s one thing you learned while working with Alexis? Then we swapped cards so no one had their own, and anyone who wanted to take money out of their account had to go back to the group and ask the group to release their funds.    PA: QuickBooks makes it very easy for us to categorize expenses, so when we hand things over to our accountant, it’s not difficult to understand where money went and is going.  MB: What’s tough about it?  MB: I know this is supposed to be a tax interview but I have to ask, you were working for Alexis Ohanian’s Initialized Capital before you left to run Yunit full-time.  PA: Even being able to answer some of the questions that our tax professional is asking to make sure they’re doing the paperwork correctly. Over a two-year period, not one person took money out of their account. The biggest benefit is we can very easily share ownership or sell shares of the company, whereas most other incorporation types don’t make that easy. The next stage is to make the app publicly available and allow people to start their own savings groups. He discussed the importance of keeping personal and business money separate, the power of using community to reach your financial goals, and the ups and downs of creating the world he wants to see.  PA: Alexis is a dreamer, and I love it. For example, keeping personal money separate from business money.  PA: My goal was to go out and raise venture money because I knew that I wanted to scale the business, and 99% of venture-backed businesses are a Delaware C-corp, which we are as well.  PA: It came a few years ago, when a partner was fired at a company where I worked.  PA: We are doing our private beta now, which is very exciting because I’m getting some great feedback. It shocked me because I didn’t know at the time that partners could be fired. And yet, no one was managing their money well.  MB: So how is Yunit structured as a business, and why did you decide to incorporate that way? So I reached out to that same person and asked him to help us out with our taxes.  Phillip Aubrey: Yunit is a mobile app that makes it easy for friends and family to save money together. You learn quickly what you can and cannot do.</description>

  <title>Q&amp;A: What Are Company Earnings, Why do They Affect Stocks?</title>

  <title>Consumer Prices Rise More Than Expected in March</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4715%2Fgas_pump_with_dollar_bills.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US consumer prices increased the most in nearly nine years in March: 0.6% over the prior month and 2.6% over last year. Some economists are concerned that too much stimulus will cause an overheated economy.   Looking ahead…the Fed expects a temporary bump in prices that will smooth out once supply chains figure their Suez out.</description>
