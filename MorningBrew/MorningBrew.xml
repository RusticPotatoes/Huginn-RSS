  <title>What's the Hype Around Air Fryers?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4440%2Fair_fryer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A few years later, van der Weij licensed the tech to Philips, which debuted the first modern air fryer at a consumer electronics show in Berlin in 2010.  But what is an air fryer? But here’s where the genius of van der Weij comes in: Air fryers get your food nice and crispy without the oil bath. The recommendation site Wirecutter put the air fryer on its “Worst Things for Most People” list. Basically, an air fryer pummels your food with hot air circulated by a high-speed fan. The pandemic, and the millions of new home chefs it spawned, may have anointed the air fryer kitchen royalty. You encounter the Maillard reaction when you eat all kinds of delicious foods, including campfire-roasted marshmallows, seared steaks, and french fries.</description>

  <title>Supply Chains Need a Factory Reset </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4430%2Ftopshot-china-health-viru.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Bottom line: There isn't one primary driver of supply chain chaos—it's simply a series of unfortunate events. Demand for lumber by home builders has outstripped supply to the point where prices have shot up more than 180% since last spring. How about a wood shortage.  Got room for one more?</description>

  <title>SPACs Post Record Q1 and Exceed 2020 Dealmaking Total</title>

It's advised 32 SPACs in Q1 for $9.2 billion in proceeds, according to Refinitiv data. Only Citigroup's got it beat with 56 SPAC IPOs for $10.5 billion. And the SEC recently warned investors to treat celebrities' SPACs with the same skepticism as their Proactiv commercials.</description>

  <title>Fed Boosts Economic Growth Projections, but Maintains Its Easy Money Strategy</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4421%2Ffederal_reserve_chair_jer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If the Fed said things do look better, then it’s increasingly hard to justify its current strategy of ultra-loose monetary policy, which is when the Fed uses its tools (like lowering interest rates) to juice the economy when it’s in the dumps. That’s not us trying to impress our middle school readers—it’s a direct quote from the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy statement yesterday.   As the US economy continues to rebound from its Covid-induced recession, the Fed projects GDP will grow 6.5% this year, a big jump from its previous estimate of 4.2% in December.</description>

  <title>Believe It or Not, Bitcoin Could Be Better Than Gold</title>

A Bit of Bitcoin BasicsYou could think of Bitcoin as magic internet money—and yes, we at Morning Brew are known for our technical economics vocabulary.  Think GoldThe best case scenario for Bitcoin probably looks something like the consistent historical value of gold. What’s super cool is that, even if the hype fades, Bitcoin may actually more likely become ensconced in our society as a thing that stores value. Its Place in Your PortfolioBitcoin has a way to go when it comes to being taken seriously by institutions and governments.  The Invisible Potential of BitcoinYou can’t see Bitcoin. File under: The best tax help around. *Bitcoin has the potential to become the digital version of gold. While gold was once traded as a physical currency, its value in the stock market is no longer tied to its industrial value. Plenty of smart people think it’s a good move to invest in Bitcoin.</description>
