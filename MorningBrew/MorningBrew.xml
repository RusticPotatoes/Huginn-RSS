Across the industry, the retail price of nondairy, plant-based milk is around twice the price of dairy milk, according to Mintec, which analyzes food commodity costs. But while those factors may help explain why plant-based milks are expensive, they don’t fully spell out why dairy milk is so cheap. While most people probably aren’t concerned about what the human star of Babe: Pig in the City sticks himself to, Cromwell’s glue-in highlights a reality for vegans and those with dairy allergies: Things tend to cost a lot more. The lactose intolerance taxIn January, Starbucks stores in the UK made all dairy alternatives free. But in the US, Starbucks locations typically charge an additional 70 cents for nondairy options. And it’s not just Starbucks charging a premium, either. So what’s keeping those oat milk prices high? —MK Zoom out: While around 36% of Americans are lactose intolerant (a condition that predominantly affects people of color), the US is still living in its Got Milk? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There’s a higher demand for dairy milk—61% of US households primarily drink it, compared to the 23% that opt for plant-based—so production costs are more spread out and retail prices are cheaper. Given that the carbon footprint of cow milk is about 3x that of alternatives like oat milk, environmental advocates like Cromwell are hoping that removing cost burdens will lead to more people giving nondairy options a chance.</description>

It’s part of a broader trend of airlines investing in faster in-air wi-fi to win over travel-hungry customers, especially now that business travel has started to rebound. But the four biggest US airlines haven’t given Starlink the time of day. A few weeks ago it announced a deal with SpaceX’s Starlink to start installing the service on some planes next year. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThe airline obsessed with boarding passengers gladiator-style is spending $2 billion to give the people what they want. They have instead partnered with wi-fi provider Viasat, which Southwest will be working with to roll out better internet for passengers by the fall.</description>

  <title>Musk tweets that his Twitter deal is ‘on hold’</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Here’s his justification for pressing pause, though:“Spam/fake accounts” might make up 5% or more of Twitter’s user base, and he’s awaiting “supporting calculation” to prove that one way or the other. In fact, courts in Delaware (where Twitter and many other companies are incorporated) have only ever identified one MAE, in 2018. Maybe, considering a) yesterday was Friday the 13th b) Musk later said he was “still committed to acquisition” and c) Musk has a history of trolling Wall Street regulators like they’re Dexter and he’s Dee Dee. He may not be blowing up any labs, but yesterday’s tweet caused Twitter stock to temporarily fall over 25%, which might constitute securities fraud since it directly impacted the market cap of a company he’s planning to purchase. The securities filing for the merger says that less than 5% of users are bots, and it contains a provision that Musk can walk away if that’s incorrect…but only if that bot problem has what’s known as a material adverse effect (MAE) on Twitter’s business. But avoiding pesky things like “the rules” is just par for the course for Musk throughout this Twitter ordeal. —JW So where does that leave us?</description>

Across the industry, the retail price of nondairy, plant-based milk is around twice the price of dairy milk, according to Mintec, which analyzes food commodity costs. But while those factors may help explain why plant-based milks are expensive, they don’t fully spell out why dairy milk is so cheap. While most people probably aren’t concerned about what the human star of Babe: Pig in the City sticks himself to, Cromwell’s glue-in highlights a reality for vegans and those with dairy allergies: Things tend to cost a lot more. The lactose intolerance taxIn January, Starbucks stores in the UK made all dairy alternatives free. But in the US, Starbucks locations typically charge an additional 70 cents for nondairy options. And it’s not just Starbucks charging a premium, either. So what’s keeping those oat milk prices high? —MK Zoom out: While around 36% of Americans are lactose intolerant (a condition that predominantly affects people of color), the US is still living in its Got Milk? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There’s a higher demand for dairy milk—61% of US households primarily drink it, compared to the 23% that opt for plant-based—so production costs are more spread out and retail prices are cheaper. Given that the carbon footprint of cow milk is about 3x that of alternatives like oat milk, environmental advocates like Cromwell are hoping that removing cost burdens will lead to more people giving nondairy options a chance.</description>

In order for crypto mortgages to be widely adopted, he said, “a lot of users need to have digital assets that have significantly appreciated in value.” css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeRupena declined to share the exact number of crypto mortgages that Milo has executed, but he said the company has already issued over $10 million worth of loans in crypto mortgages. Though the industry is growing, it’s not for the average crypto HODLer.Ledn, Figure, and Milo all allow customers to take out mortgages by putting up cryptocurrency as collateral without cashing it out, unlike a standard mortgage where a new homeowner has the pleasure of handing over their down payment in cash on closing. Crypto mortgage companies let customers hold onto their digital currencies for a couple of reasons: First, crypto believers don’t want to liquidate their portfolio and transfer it back to dollars, just in case the price of crypto continues to rise and they miss post-liquidation gains. Rupena said that’s “incredibly encouraging,” since he’s looking for customers who want to use crypto to buy their home without selling their digital assets (and paying the subsequent taxes). Though this threat of margin calls and freefalling crypto values may be anxiety-inducing, Milo CEO Josip Rupena argues that “overall, it’s a safer mortgage transaction” than some traditional mortgages, since homeowners can liquidate their crypto before going into foreclosure.</description>
