The North American Meat Institute said the report “cherry picks data to support a narrative that is completely unrepresentative of the early days of an unprecedented national emergency.” Well, a new House subcommittee report concluded that meatpacking companies  exaggerated product shortages during the height of the pandemic to keep plants open and skirt Covid health guidelines. According to the report, Tyson even drafted the executive order issued by former President Trump in April 2020 to keep plants open.</description>

  <title>Crypto-backed mortgages let HODLers become homeowners</title>

In order for crypto mortgages to be widely adopted, he said, “a lot of users need to have digital assets that have significantly appreciated in value.” css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeRupena declined to share the exact number of crypto mortgages that Milo has executed, but he said the company has already issued over $10 million worth of loans in crypto mortgages. Though the industry is growing, it’s not for the average crypto HODLer.Ledn, Figure, and Milo all allow customers to take out mortgages by putting up cryptocurrency as collateral without cashing it out, unlike a standard mortgage where a new homeowner has the pleasure of handing over their down payment in cash on closing. Crypto mortgage companies let customers hold onto their digital currencies for a couple of reasons: First, crypto believers don’t want to liquidate their portfolio and transfer it back to dollars, just in case the price of crypto continues to rise and they miss post-liquidation gains. Rupena said that’s “incredibly encouraging,” since he’s looking for customers who want to use crypto to buy their home without selling their digital assets (and paying the subsequent taxes). Though this threat of margin calls and freefalling crypto values may be anxiety-inducing, Milo CEO Josip Rupena argues that “overall, it’s a safer mortgage transaction” than some traditional mortgages, since homeowners can liquidate their crypto before going into foreclosure.</description>

  <title>Atlanta rapper Young Thug’s own lyrics could be used against him in RICO charge</title>

Georgia prosecutors allege that Williams is one of the organizers of the Atlanta gang Young Slime Life (YSL), which has been accused of a number of violent crimes, including a 2015 murder. Williams’s lawyer told the LA Times the claims were “frivolous” and that they will “fight it and litigate it ethically, and lawfully and zealously.” —MM The law allows the state to find multiple parties guilty if it can prove that everyone in the organization committed two or more serious crimes that were part of a larger racketeering plan. In the indictment, prosecutors named nine songs that they claim are evidence of Williams’s criminal activity. Behind the charges is a 1970s statute created to take down mobsters, known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Prosecutors are using the state’s RICO law to charge Williams and his associates—including rappers Yak Gotti, Gunna, and Williams’s brother Unfoonk—with crimes they may not have committed, but were involved in vis-a-vis YSL.</description>

Even as terra clawed back some of its value on Tuesday, its plunge sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, raising existential questions around the stability—and viability—of stablecoins. A stablecoin is a crypto that is tied to the value of government-backed currency, and the most popular ones right now are all pegged to $1. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeTerraUSD is a type of cryptocurrency known as an algorithmic stablecoin, and its whole schtick is that it’s always supposed to be worth $1. To keep the coin from crashing completely, the organization behind terra is dipping into its stockpile of $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin to lend to trading platforms. That incentivizes terra owners to trade back and forth between the two currencies to make a profit, aka arbitrage. —JW css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! When terra’s price fluctuates, a financial algorithm kicks in to adjust luna’s price so that terra is always equivalent to $1 worth of luna.

Two-thirds of the group that was unable to get abortions were living in poverty within six months, compared to 45% of the group that was able to receive the procedure. “One aspect of a satisfying life is being able to feel that you have the financial resources to raise a child,” Yellen responded. “I believe that eliminating the rights of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades,” Secretary Yellen told lawmakers yesterday. Officials supporting that law have argued that Roe v.

Even as terra clawed back most of its value on Tuesday, algorithmic stablecoins became the pineapple-on-pizza debate of the crypto community. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeTerraUSD is a type of cryptocurrency known as an algorithmic stablecoin, and its whole schtick is that it’s always supposed to be worth $1. When terra’s price fluctuates, a financial algorithm kicks in to adjust luna’s price so that terra is always equivalent to $1 worth of luna. —JW css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! That incentivizes terra owners to trade back and forth between the two currencies to make a profit, aka arbitrage. Here’s how terra works:A cryptocurrency called luna works in conjunction with terra. A stablecoin is worth a set amount of a fiat currency, and the most popular ones right now are all pegged to $1. The crypto community losing faith in terra's $1 value has triggered what Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called a run. To keep the currency from crashing completely, the organization behind terra is dipping into its stockpile of $3.5 billion worth of bitcoin to lend to trading platforms.</description>

  <title>College students are split on whether companies should have a public stance on abortion access</title>

Moving factor: Immediately following a final SCOTUS decision, 23 states could restrict abortion access, including 13 states ready with “trigger laws” to outlaw abortion completely. Reimbursement split: When asked if private companies should cover the cost of travel for employees who need to go out of state to receive abortions, 52% said yes and 48% said no. In a Generation Lab–Morning Brew poll, we asked 813 college students around the country how abortion access would influence their future career choices and whether they think companies should make public statements on the matter. When students were asked how important abortion access is in deciding where they’ll live in the future, 30% said “not important at all,” 16% said “a little important” and the remaining 54% were split between “very important” and “somewhat important.” css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! stance: 41% of college students think companies should make public statements regarding abortion rights in light of the recent SCOTUS news. 32% said companies shouldn’t and 26% said they weren’t sure. A few hours before Politico published the draft opinion, Amazon did announce it would reimburse employees for some abortion-related travel if they are on Amazon’s health insurance.</description>

Two-thirds of the group that was unable to get abortions were living in poverty within six months, compared to 45% of the group that was able to receive the procedure. “One aspect of a satisfying life is being able to feel that you have the financial resources to raise a child,” Yellen responded. “I believe that eliminating the rights of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades,” Secretary Yellen told lawmakers yesterday. Officials supporting that law have argued that Roe v. Scholars argue that abortion access was an important factor in raising that rate to 57.4% by 2019. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeFallout from a leaked draft of a Supreme Court ruling that would overturn Roe v. —MK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!

From ethics to social issues, here are five areas that motivate Gen Z, plus a few Gen Z vocab words to add to your dictionary. This means high APRs and “buy now, pay later” offers are kinda sus4—and banks that don’t charge overdraft fees and do ditch their punitive debt cycles are likely to score the biggest W with Gen Z. )And for all our numbers people: 7 in 10 Gen Zers want safety and security in their lives. Brands have the reach, money, and scale to create change—change that Gen Z is adamant about seeing in the world. For retailers, this means Gen Zers want to walk into safe stores and use products made with safe materials. No. 5: Social issuesThe easiest way to earn Gen Z’s trust? Gen Z shoppers stan1 ethical brands—and they’ll go out of their way to shop at retailers that go the extra mile to treat their workforces with dignity. Gen Z is made up of many individuals and smaller demographic groups, and their collective ideals are built on style and substance. No. 1: EthicsGen Z supports brands that take care of their employees. But first: Why should Gen Z matter to me? Naturally, brands that use their influence to take a stance on important issues will be brands that Gen Z not only high-key5 loves but also trusts.</description>

While much of the pageantry will be the same as ever (a huge military parade through Moscow’s Red Square, for example), there’s also a great deal of apprehension this year over whether President Vladimir Putin will announce an escalation of what Russia has called a “special military operation” in Ukraine into a full-scale war.

Gucci will start accepting $SHIB—as well as more than 10 other cryptocurrencies—at select stores later this month and nationwide this summer as part of the luxury sector’s wider push into crypto. But it’s playing catch-up to other luxury brands that have rushed to accept crypto for goods:Off-White announced in March that its flagship stores started taking crypto as payment. —JW css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! Bottom line: A collab between luxury brands and crypto may be the best match since jazz and rain, because both rely on hype and clout. How it’ll work: In-store shoppers who want to reinvest their bitcoin into a crossbody will be emailed a QR code that allows them to complete the transaction using their crypto wallets. Philipp Plein is one-upping its peers by building a London store where customers can pay in crypto, browse an NFT gallery, and upgrade certain purchases with a corresponding NFT they can wear in the virtual world of Decentraland.</description>
