  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4270%2Fgreatest_product_of_all_time_logo.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product with more votes when the polls close will advance to the next round.  Over the next two weeks, Morning Brew readers will have the opportunity to select the Greatest Product of All Time (GPOAT).  How does a product advance through the bracket? what makes a product “great”? We’ll start with 64 products, separated into four different “regions” of 16 products. Some products truly are great.  How it works: The competition mirrors the format of the NCAA’s March Madness tournament.</description>

  <title>How to File Your Taxes as an S-corp</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4259%2Fwoman_at_computer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Here’s an example: Let’s say you’re a shareholder of an S-corp called Debi’s Awesome Snacks.    Taxes for S-corps and C-corps are due on March 15 so that shareholders have the info they need to file individual income taxes before April 15. which spits out a K-1 and is filed with each owner’s personal income taxes (this is how income tax transfers from business to owner). An S-corp is not as well known but offers a key advantage for qualifying LLCs and C-corps: Income taxes are passed through to the shareholders’ tax returns. We’ve gone over how to file your taxes as a sole proprietor and a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), two very common ways to incorporate a business. So let us be clear: Attempting to DIY your taxes as an S-corp is like skiing up the mountain instead of taking a lift.</description>

  <title>Biden Prepares to Eliminate $10,000 in Student Loans</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F979%2Fcollege_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, President Biden is expected to tackle the mounting student loan crisis with a powerful weapon: forgiveness. Forgive $10,000, which would clear balances for a third of borrowers and put a nice dent into outstanding balances for the largest group of borrowers, who hold between $20k–$40k. About 45 million Americans have outstanding student loans. Many may never have completed their degrees. The government could also expand loan forgiveness programs or enroll more borrowers in income-based repayment plans. But not everyone, even within his own party, agrees on how much he should forgive—or whether he should at all. Critics of student loan forgiveness argue that it benefits an already privileged class (college grads) and doesn’t address the root problem of expensive tuition. The state of student debt There’s a lot of it.  Biden’s optionsDo nothing. A generous gift...</description>

  <title>The Conversation Around Vaccine Passports Heats Up</title>

Some cruise lines have also announced they’ll require vaccination for guests and crew for the privilege of sailing the Covid-free seas.</description>

  <title>Nasdaq Turns Negative, 10-Year Rises as Fed Sticks to Status Quo</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2230%2Fjerome_powell.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an interview with the WSJ, Powell said that while he expects some inflation ahead, he doesn't think it'll last and the Fed will keep interest rates near zero. Inflation worries have sent bond yields—still low by historic standards—spiking, making investors worry that the Fed will raise interest rates to put a brake on the economy and keep inflation in check.   That sounded reassuring, but investors are still feeling nervous about inflation and the Fed potentally hiking rates. Yesterday, they turned to Fed Chair Jerome Powell for a reassuring hug.</description>

  <title>Google Commits to Phasing Out Invasive Third-Party Cookies</title>

To a certain extent, the modern advertising businesses of internet giants like Google and Facebook are built on the buttery backs of cookies. Currently, using cookies, Google can see that a user was shopping for a new golf bag on Amazon, then later serve them a Callaway ad next to a Golf.  Now, through a program called “Privacy Sandbox,” Google is testing a way for companies to target ads to groups of users with similar interests instead of directly to individuals.</description>
