  <title>Help Definitely Wanted: The Restaurant Industry Faces A Labor Crunch</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5662%2Fmcdonald_s_sign_advertising_job_openings.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The restaurant business, inherently and pre-Covid, was a toxic workplace," North Carolina restaurant owner Patrick Whalen told CNN. But many former restaurant workers also found more stable jobs in other industries and didn’t look back.  After surveying over 2,800 food service workers, UC Berkeley Food Labor Research Center said the top three reasons that they’d leave their jobs are low wages and tips, lingering Covid-19 fears, and concerns of hostility from customers.  Where did they go?</description>

  <title>Exclusive: What’s the Job Market for College Students Like This Summer?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F979%2Fcollege_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In a Morning Brew + Generation Lab poll, we asked 500 college students about their work plans for this summer and how they're feeling about it. After the unemployment rate for younger workers shot up to 32% last summer, the jobless rate for teens dropped to 9.6% this May, the lowest it's been since 1953, and stayed pretty steady in June at 9.9%.</description>

  <title>Diving into the Great Resignation and What It Means for American Workers</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5648%2Fpeggy_quitting_on_mad_men.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, the main reason employees are quitting their jobs en masse, Harvard economics professor Jason Furman argues, is simpler: There are a record number of job openings in the US right now (9.3 million), and in any economy where lots of jobs are available, people leave their existing roles for greener pastures. A bunch of your coworkers are going to quit their jobs over the next few months—if you don’t leave before then.  In what’s been dubbed the “Great Resignation,” 4 million people, or 2.7% of US workers, quit their jobs in April. If they’re not pampered, they’re skedaddling.</description>

This was fascinating: 31% of students said their biggest concern when going to work this summer was understaffing at their employers, beating out worries over health and safety and working remotely. Most of the students having an easier time finding summer work are white.</description>

  <title>Money Matters: When to Pay Off Student Loans? </title>

If you think an investment will return more than your highest interest rate, you might want to start investing some money. Say your only debt is a student loan at 5% interest. If you think an investment will return more than 5% this year, investing might be a good shout. Should college grads start investing before paying off all student loans?  </description>

  <title>US Economy Adds 850,000 Jobs in June in Bullish Sign for Labor Market</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/lnMsxRxL4RCzdzTRHu/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US economy added 850,000 jobs in June, marking the biggest monthly gain in almost a year and topping expectations. The 850,000 headline number represents a big improvement from May’s jobs report (+583,000 jobs) and April’s (+269,000). Economists hope that the increase in job seekers in June is a sign the labor crunch could smooth out by fall. Challenges remain, of course.</description>

  <title>Origin Stories: July Fourth’s Favorite Companies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5659%2F2018_nathan_s_famous_hot_dog_eating_contest.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nathan’s Hot DogsYes, a guy named Nathan did actually start this company. Old Navy became the first clothing company to reach $1 billion in sales in its first four years of business. What’s up with the matching Old Navy shirts in every single one of our family pics? In 2012, Solo was acquired by Dart Container for $1 billion, and according to the company’s website, fans post 400,000+ photos with the iconic red cup every year.  Red Solo cupIt’s the early 1930s in Chicago, and disposable cups are all the rage after the city council banned the use of germy “common drinking cups” 20 years before. The contest, where competitors have 10 minutes to inhale as many hot dogs as they can, has aired live on ESPN since 2004. Why is Nathan's the first name you think of when you picture a hot dog? In 1916, Nathan Handwerker began selling hot dogs in New York’s Coney Island for five cents.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How to Address a Pay Gap Issue</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Hey Kate, I recently discovered that I am being paid 25%–33% less than my male colleagues working in the same position with the same level of education and work experience. Each week, Morning Brew's Head of People Ops Kate Noel answers reader-submitted questions about work in 2021.  If you don’t get a positive response, maybe it’s time to look for an employer that values your talents and experience. Be clear, specific, and confident!</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...Beeple</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5657%2Fpicture_of_beeple.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;And that's not a part of NFTs.What is the future of NFTs? NFTs will be part of your life, just because they'll be the easiest way to prove that you own things. This WENEW project is one new use case for NFTs. As more use cases come, more people will learn about this technology and see value in it for something that connects to their lives.  It's been really exciting to be a part of something that feels like it's the beginning. It’s still the most expensive NFT ever sold.  The other thing that is tough for people to understand is that one of the main aspects of ownership with many things is being able to restrict access to that thing. They’ll be attached to a bunch of different things that make it easy to prove that you are the one single person that has that thing.  You’ve had quite a year, selling an NFT for $69 million. It’s a super exciting time, and I feel very honored to be a part of that.</description>

  <title>Robinhood Announces IPO After $70 Million Finra Fine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F2127%2Frobinhood_illustration.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For instance, Robinhood wants you to buy into Robinhood’s IPO on Robinhood. In an unusual move, it’s setting aside 20%–35% of its Class A stock for its customers, as opposed to bankers. US-listed IPOs have already raised over $190 billion so far in 2021, more than 2020’s total.</description>

The relaxation of rules governing name, image, and likeness (NIL) allows college athletes to sign endorsement deals and make money off their fame for the first time, resulting in a “transcendent day for American sports,” Sports Illustrated writes.</description>

Bottom line: At 100 years old, the Communist Party remains a potent global force led by a president who could be the first since Mao to rule until he dies. Its caginess around the origins of Covid-19 has made things worse.</description>
