  <title>Google Commits to Phasing Out Invasive Third-Party Cookies</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4244%2Fgoogle_cookie_jar.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;That way, businesses can still serve targeted ads, but your specific user data is a little more private since Google is essentially hiding it in a crowd. To a certain extent, the modern advertising businesses of internet giants like Google and Facebook are built on the buttery backs of cookies. Currently, using cookies, Google can see that a user was shopping for a new golf bag on Amazon, then later serve them a Callaway ad next to a Golf.  Now, through a program called “Privacy Sandbox,” Google is testing a way for companies to target ads to groups of users with similar interests instead of directly to individuals.</description>

  <title>Senate Prepares for Stimulus Vote</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3974%2Fbiden_stimulus_plan.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; It's a win for centristsLike their House colleagues, Senate Republicans will likely unanimously oppose the bill. Now that the wage increase is out, a handful of moderate Democrats who were skeptical of it are more likely to support the bill. If it passes, the House will need to vote again on a matching version.   </description>

  <title>Buy-Now-Pay-Later Giant Klarna Worth $31B After Latest Round of Funding</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4222%2Fklarna.JPG&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why the BNPL hype? Companies like Macy's and Neiman Marcus still rely heavily on store- and co-branded credit card fees to pad their bottom lines, offerings that compete with BNPL options.  One of the earliest companies to the BNPL game, Klarna offers consumers the option to pay for an item online in installments rather than all at once.  But BNPL has put retail giants in a pickle.  That concerns regulators, since more than than 10% of customers at one bank that had used BNPL were already behind on their payments, according to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.</description>

  <title>Sen. Warren Unveils Wealth Tax Proposal</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4221%2Felizabeth_warren.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   While many politicians agree the ultra-wealthy should pay more, some disagree about whether wealth taxes are the way to go.  Wealth taxes are distinct from the income taxes you're probably filing right now.  Bottom line: The bill isn't expected to pass, even with Democratic control of Congress and the White House.</description>

  <title>Warren Buffett Releases Annual Shareholder Letter and Berkshire Hathaway Earnings</title>

Berkshire also bought back almost $25 billion of its own stock last year, reducing the total number of outstanding shares and increasing current investors’ ownership.  Looking ahead...  But notice what isn’t there: the pandemic, racial justice protests, the election, GameStop, and crypto. “There has been no incubator for unleashing human potential like America.”</description>
