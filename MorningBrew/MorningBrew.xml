  <title>Why SaaS Giant Salesforce Bought Slack</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3271/slack_salesforce.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Zoom out: Salesforce and Slack have a common, four-paned enemy: Microsoft.   For Salesforce: Slack will join analytics company Tableau and cloud provider Vlocity in Salesforce's growing stable of business services offerings.

  <title>Stocks, Crypto Post Record-Setting Month</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7abIileRivlGr8Nq/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Non-cryptocurrency: The dollar had its worst month since July, which is a sign investors stayed away from the safe haven asset and piled into riskier bets.   It's not totally surprising.

Looking ahead…with a slowing recovery, worsening pandemic, and one month until ~12 million U.S. workers lose federal unemployment benefits, Biden's team will face the economic equivalent of Alabama in Week 1.</description>
