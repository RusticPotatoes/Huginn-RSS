  <title>MindMed Becomes the US’ Second Public Psychedelics Company</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4878%2Fmindmed_graphic.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  “Therapists are going to be a key component of making this whole new approach work,” Rahn said.  Bottom line: Don’t expect to cure your anxiety by taking MindMed’s meds in the woods with friends. In November, Oregon became the first state to legalize the medical use of psilocybin, and other jurisdictions are moving in that direction.</description>

But if there's one thing we know about Tesla...</description>

  <title>Four Tips and Tricks to Better B2B Ads</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4866%2Fbranding_masters.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Avoid Coming Off Like a Jargon Junkie Biz and brand jargon are like a ghost pepper hot sauce—a little can go a long way.  That being said, we firmly believe that a niche jargon-plug used in an unexpected way can be just the thing you need to get that giggle and drive engagement.  AKA: make sure your brand reaches your target audience where they spend the most time.  Make sure you’re using places like your website and LinkedIn to establish who you are and allow you to iterate on your branding as things change.  On LinkedIn, for example, you can combine multiple criteria to create sophisticated targeting and use video or Led Gen Form retargeting to make your marketing pop—just saying. But as too many people know (not us, we’re perfect) ads often stand out in a not so good way.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers with... Cameo CEO Steven Galanis</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4838%2Fsteven_galanis.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I collect a lot now—this even predates Cameo and I think it's one of the reasons I got into it. You started Cameo while still working at LinkedIn. What was the "aha" moment when you knew you were ready to go full-time?  I think people can blow up on Cameo and become sensations there. My brain chemistry changed that day, and I just knew I had to go and pursue this. So I would probably love to be one of the 300 Spartans that fought. I don't think we can take you from zero to one, but I think we could take you from one to 10. If you could live in the setting of any book or movie, what would it be? I grew up as a hockey player.  And the answer was no.</description>

  <title>Italian Man Skips Work for 15 Years, Still Gets Paid</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2YWrtthgz6PzBmFi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Scumace could face charges of abuse of office, forgery, and aggravated extortion, but he’ll go down in Italian history as the “king of absentees.” Slacking off as a public sector worker is a rampant-enough problem in Italy that Italians call perpetrators a name that roughly translates to “timecard weasels.”</description>

  <title>Italian Man Skips Work for 15 Years, Still Gets Paid</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/l2YWrtthgz6PzBmFi/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Scumace could face charges of abuse of office, forgery, and aggravated extortion, but he’ll go down in Italian history as the “king of absentees.” Slacking off as a public sector worker is a rampant-enough problem in Italy that Italians call perpetrators a name that roughly translates to “timecard weasels.”</description>

  <title>The $0 Budget Movie That Topped the Pandemic Box Office</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F3303%2Ftv_movie_theater.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  No one attended the movie besides Nilsson and Tabach, but after three screenings of Unsubscribe, they managed to pay enough money to themselves for the movie to top the box office. Perhaps no image captures the preposterousness of the last year for movie theaters than the box office chart for June 10, 2020.  One thing's for sure: As charming a story as it is, if a movie like Unsubscribe tops the box office again something will have gone very, very wrong. Hollywood bulls say to look at the recent box office success of Godzilla vs.   Box Office Mojo On that day, a Wednesday, a movie called Unsubscribe topped the US charts with $25,488 in gross earnings, beating out several other movies that were shown at drive-ins. if you had one shot...</description>

Yes, I know that you reaaally want to land a job.   I'm a Black woman and entrepreneur, but given the past year's difficulties, I'm contemplating going back to the workforce. I switch my hairstyle probably every two months and absolutely no one makes weird comments or makes it a point of discussion at the beginning of Zoom meetings.</description>

  <title>5 Things to Know About Rideshare Driver Taxes</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4824%2Fuber_driver.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A deduction just for existingNow that we’ve covered how Uber and Lyft drivers can lower tax bills by deducting business expenses, it’s time to talk about the other ways you can keep trimming. Tyler, 31, a Florida-based rideshare driver since 2015 and writer for The Rideshare Guy, told the Brew that even as a part-time gig worker, the actual expense method has “never even come close” to the more sizable standard mileage rate deduction. They’re also required to send a copy to the IRS, so tax authorities know how much you earned before you even file your taxes. It’s always tax season in the gig economyAn underrated perk of being a W-2 employee: Your employer is required to withhold a portion of each paycheck for federal, state, and payroll taxes. “If your car starts to take more repairs than you're making, and you're going to continue to drive for rideshare, then it might be time to get a new car,” he said. The IRS helps you cover the cost of gas, repairs, and other expenses with a deduction that you can calculate in one of two ways. Here’s the formula:Standard mileage deduction = (Business miles x IRS standard mileage rate) + Unreimbursed parking and tollsIf your mileage tracker says you drove 10,000 miles for Lyft in 2020, you’d qualify for a $5,750 vehicle expense deduction. Two ways to deduct vehicle expensesDriving for Uber does to your car what dairy does to my body: makes it cry for help. Other common deductible rideshare driver expenses are:Vehicle expensesUnreimbursed tolls and feesHand sanitizerFace masksFlashlightsFlaresFloor matsJumper cablesFirst aid kitsAir freshenersWagons for big grocery deliveriesWater bottles for ridersMusic subscriptions (like Pandora or Apple Music) for rider enjoymentJaz, 29, is a full-time gig worker who drives for Uber, Uber Eats, Lyft, DoorDash, Postmates, you get the idea, and documents it all on her YouTube channel. With the standard mileage rate, you’re waiving the right to deduct most vehicle expenses independently. These forms of income are still taxable, with or without the tax document. Completes 200 rides or deliveriesDrivers who don’t reach the 1099-K minimums might be asking: How do I file my taxes without a tax form?</description>

  <title>Biden Will Propose Nearly Doubling Capital Gains Tax</title>

Critics of the current capital gains system say, "So you're telling me this rich investor is paying less in taxes on their stock sales than a middle-class worker pays on their income? To pay for his second proposal, which includes spending on childcare and paid leave for workers, he wants to hike taxes on wealthy investors.</description>
