  <title>Exclusive: Post-Pandemic, Summer Travel Trends to Watch</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5066%2Froad_trip_big_sur.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the top 20 most popular flight deals Scott's Cheap Flights sent subscribers over the last two months, multiple were roundtrips to Hawaii and Alaska. 39% of travelers said they're concerned about travel costs. While more travelers are looking to get their delayed Eurotrip on, domestic travel is still the name of the game this summer, Keyes said. When countries announce they're reopening borders for US travelers, there's a predictable spike in flight searches to that destination, according to Keyes. Almost 60% said the frequency of their summer travel plans is similar to pre-pandemic levels. Of the 30% of respondents who work remotely at least one day a week, 42% said it's positively impacted their ability to travel.  Some people don't know what they're doing yetDue to pandemic uncertainty, many travelers have waited until closer to their intended travel date to book.</description>

  <title>Business Trends to Watch This Summer</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5295%2Fsummer_2021_preview.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are other consumer trends I'm excited to watch this summer.  —Neal FreymanCryptoMaybe I'm on Twitter too much, but cryptocurrency, and more specifically cryptocurrency regulation, is the top business topic I'll be watching this summer. Vaccine inequality In just six months, the US has vaccinated over half its adult population, a remarkable feat considering how much we seemed to lag other countries in controlling the virus last year. Is home fitness here to stay even as gyms reopen? Let us know if we missed any. I think the big thing to watch is whether supply chains getting back to normal will cause the inflation scaries to subside. In the last two months, there have been gas, lumber, chip, ketchup, worker, and boba shortages, just to name a few that had accompanying Morning Brew pieces. Inflation data over the summer will reveal whether this quirkiness is more permanent than officials had thought.  —Yiran Yu  Btw, have you experienced the awkwardness of a post-Covid hug/handshake? After soaring more than 400% in 2020, Peloton's stock is down almost 24% this year. Maybe.</description>

  <title>Costco Sees Inflationary Pressures, but Will Restart Free Samples</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4188%2Fcostco.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the company said that price inflation at the selling level, excluding gasoline, was 2.5%–3.5%, much higher than in March. Costco was one of the first US retailers to mandate masks in early May 2020. Costco is the only place where you can simultaneously buy seven-pound tubs of Nutella and learn about the state of the post-pandemic economy. And probably come back in two minutes and hope you forget our face. But hey, we’ll take it. And samples will be given behind plexiglass screens.</description>

What's something that podcasting offers that books don't and vice versa? Tell us about something you love doing that you're terrible at. And tell us about something you really do not like doing that you're great at. What star rating would you give the five-star rating scale?  Name three books on your nightstand right now:Clint Smith's How the Word Is Passed, Ashley C.  If you could own any sports franchise other than the English soccer team AFC Wimbledon, of which you are a huge fan, what would it be? In 175 words, one can say much more about a book (or a movie, or a hotel, or a barbershop) than a single data point ever could.</description>

Tom Cotton, were pushing the US government to investigate claims that the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  As researchers studied Covid-19's origins last year, the natural origin theory dominated and the lab leak theory was considered preposterous. this lab leak theory may not be as crazy as it sounds." But as 2020 went on, scientists found no evidence to support the natural origin theory, China was stonewalling any credible independent investigation, and people started saying, "You know what... Lab leak: A scientist at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies bat viruses, was infected with a contagious strain through a sloppy mistake or an accident, and brought it out to the wider world.</description>

The backstory: In December, Engine No. 1, then a brand new hedge fund, bought ~$40 million of Exxon shares—just 0.02% of the company—and sent a letter to the board with a simple request: Invest in clean energy, or else.
