An Elon Musk tweet about the viral song “Baby Shark” sent shares of Samsung Publishing, a company that owns a big stake in the song’s producer, up more than 10%. We thought meme stocks peaked with the bankrupt Hertz last summer, or GameStop this winter, but just this week...</description>

  <title>Hack Shuts Down JBS Meat Processing Operations</title>

  <title>Stock Analysis 101</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5302%2Fchart.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can find company financials through the SEC EDGAR portal. If the same company is trading at $20 per share, the PE ratio is 20. It’s more about finding patterns in the stock price that investors can exploit. Here are some signs of a company with a blossoming future:Lasting edge in the market: You want to invest in a company that has some competitive advantage in its sector. It’s the same thing with picking stocks: You want to invest in companies that are part of a growing industry. It’s OK if you’re feeling this way, because there’s more to a stock price than the numbers. Vincent Glode, a finance professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told the Brew that looking beyond the numbers can help you feel more confident about the stock. You won’t find any analysis there, so head over to a site like Yahoo Finance to see what investors are thinking. Chat with a financial advisor about the most responsible way to fit stock trading into your portfolio. Then, move onto valuation ratios, which compare a company’s financial results to its price in the market. Do your own researchAt first, financial statements can look like they’re written in Klingon. Financial market experts agree that identifying stocks that’ll beat the overall market is hard. Review the numbersNo matter your approach, it’s a good idea to take a look at the company’s financials before investing. In general, you want a quick ratio higher than 1. They care less about the company’s intrinsic value and more about how the stock price will shift in the future. See what analysts—and even your friends—are saying about the company’s future in qualitative terms. Fundamental analysis involves determining the company’s intrinsic value from the bottom up, from examining historical financial statements to imagining the company’s future. Analysts often associate industries with specific ratios that best depict a company’s financials.  Put it all togetherThis is where investment analysts take their research, create a financial model, and forecast the company’s future financials before making a trading decision. That’s why you often see higher trading volume around earnings reports. Analysts from major financial institutions put out their predictions ahead of companies’ earnings announcements, and a company’s goal is for these metrics to meet or exceed analyst expectations. Much of what’s built into a company’s stock price is investors’ expectations of the future, from new product lines to shifting market conditions. Investment analysts have already crunched the numbers, so you can put away your TI-83. If the company’s market cap—or total value in the market—is $50 million and sales were $5 million for the last 12-month period, the PSR is 10. “Psychological views of companies can last a very long time.”</description>

  <title>China Adopts Three-Child Policy Rule to Boost Population</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/cAMfDqovnTpqDhm1OR/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The US population grew at its slowest rate since the Great Depression from 2010–2020, and its birth rate declined for the sixth straight year last year.  Why it matters: Declining population growth has profound implications for a country's economic success.     Zoom out: While many parts of the world face stagnant population growth, others are making up for it. Bottom line: As much as the Chinese government wants to grow the country's share of the world population, it might be fighting a losing battle.</description>

  <title>Exclusive: Post-Pandemic, Summer Travel Trends to Watch</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5066%2Froad_trip_big_sur.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Of the top 20 most popular flight deals Scott's Cheap Flights sent subscribers over the last two months, multiple were roundtrips to Hawaii and Alaska. 39% of travelers said they're concerned about travel costs. While more travelers are looking to get their delayed Eurotrip on, domestic travel is still the name of the game this summer, Keyes said. When countries announce they're reopening borders for US travelers, there's a predictable spike in flight searches to that destination, according to Keyes. Almost 60% said the frequency of their summer travel plans is similar to pre-pandemic levels. Of the 30% of respondents who work remotely at least one day a week, 42% said it's positively impacted their ability to travel.  Some people don't know what they're doing yetDue to pandemic uncertainty, many travelers have waited until closer to their intended travel date to book.</description>

  <title>Business Trends to Watch This Summer</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5295%2Fsummer_2021_preview.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But there are other consumer trends I'm excited to watch this summer.  —Neal FreymanCryptoMaybe I'm on Twitter too much, but cryptocurrency, and more specifically cryptocurrency regulation, is the top business topic I'll be watching this summer. Vaccine inequality In just six months, the US has vaccinated over half its adult population, a remarkable feat considering how much we seemed to lag other countries in controlling the virus last year. Is home fitness here to stay even as gyms reopen? Let us know if we missed any. I think the big thing to watch is whether supply chains getting back to normal will cause the inflation scaries to subside. In the last two months, there have been gas, lumber, chip, ketchup, worker, and boba shortages, just to name a few that had accompanying Morning Brew pieces. Inflation data over the summer will reveal whether this quirkiness is more permanent than officials had thought.  —Yiran Yu  Btw, have you experienced the awkwardness of a post-Covid hug/handshake? After soaring more than 400% in 2020, Peloton's stock is down almost 24% this year. Maybe.</description>

  <title>Costco Sees Inflationary Pressures, but Will Restart Free Samples</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4188%2Fcostco.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, the company said that price inflation at the selling level, excluding gasoline, was 2.5%–3.5%, much higher than in March. Costco was one of the first US retailers to mandate masks in early May 2020. Costco is the only place where you can simultaneously buy seven-pound tubs of Nutella and learn about the state of the post-pandemic economy. And probably come back in two minutes and hope you forget our face. But hey, we’ll take it. And samples will be given behind plexiglass screens.</description>
