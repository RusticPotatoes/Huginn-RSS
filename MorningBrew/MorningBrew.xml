  <title>The big get bigger: JPMorgan to acquire First Republic</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeAnother one bites the dust: Authorities seized First Republic Bank this morning and sold most of its assets to JPMorgan, the country’s largest bank. First Republic tried to weather the storm itself, but after customers withdrew more than $100 billion in deposits in Q1 and its share price plunged nearly 75% last week alone, the government had to hang the “closed” sign on the door. But by quickly finding a buyer over the weekend, the government avoided the unsavory tactic it had to deploy for SVB: protecting deposits over the federally insured cap of $250,000. JPMorgan said it will assume First Republic’s $92 billion in deposits, which is a welcome outcome since making SVB depositors whole cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund about $20 billion. First Citizens collected the scraps of SVB, New York Community Bank snatched up assets of Signature Bank, and UBS absorbed crosstown rival Credit Suisse. Like SVB, First Republic is a midsized California-based lender with a specific client base—in this case, wealthy individuals—that made it particularly exposed to the shockwaves of the recent banking turmoil.</description>

  <title>Why your super online friends are talking about Bluesky</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. On a decentralized platform, one person does not have the power to create rules that govern the entire ecosystem. One of the most recently disillusioned people with Musk is none other than Dorsey. Bluesky is very similar to Twitter, which makes sense since it was originally a side project of Twitter’s and is funded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeIf you aren’t on the internet as much as I am (which…congrats, that’s healthier), then you might not have heard of Bluesky, a social media app that’s gaining traction as an alternative to Twitter. Writing on Bluesky, Dorsey said “it all went south” once Musk bought Twitter.</description>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeUnlike in the chess heydays of the last century, one need not be a Bobby Fischer-level genius to achieve chess stardom now. The sport was likely helped along last year by a perfect hype storm created by Magnus Carlsen, the world’s No. 1 chess player, accusing an opponent of cheating in an in-person game, as well as a Louis Vuitton campaign in which Messi and Ronaldo faced off across a chess board. One of the most popular chess YouTubers, Levy Rozman, is a pro, but he lacks the grandmaster designation of top-tier players. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}.

  <title>No Shave November in May…but for lawns</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. In past years, participants have watched their lawns transform from an “ecological dead zone”—as one professor calls the average American yard—into a tall-grassed ecosystem rife with bumblebees, songbirds, chipmunks, and other forest friends... But some environmentalists say No Mow May isn’t the right way to bring biodiversity back to residential areas because it “teases” insects and other pollinators. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeTo mow or not to mow? —ML That is the question homeowners are debating as more cities and towns embrace No Mow May, a movement started in 2019 to revitalize backyard wildlife by refraining from lawn care for an entire month. The Guelph Turfgrass Institute suggests channeling the benefits of No Mow May throughout the other 11 months by sectioning off a part of the yard as a permanent “wildflower zone.”</description>

  <title>Pour one out for First Republic</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. First Republic got hit extra hard by the crisis because it had successfully pursued wealthy clients in order to grow. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeFirst Republic Bank might be breathing its last breaths. The bank panic that led to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank left First Republic’s depositors worried about whether it could stay afloat. Looking ahead…if the bank fails, regulators will have some busy days ahead of them deciding whether to make First Republic depositors whole and assuring the public that the banking sector isn’t in trouble. Things calmed down after heavy hitters, including JPMorgan and Bank of America, deposited $30 billion in the bank last month. Its once enviable client list became a liability since two-thirds of accounts at the bank had balances above $250k—so most depositors knew they wouldn’t be made whole by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if First Republic ran into trouble.</description>

  <title>Why are rent prices still so high?</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1494930b05846b2adc1919ee52a5916f76df6e06-1500x1000.jpg?w=900&amp;h=600&amp;q=80&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Rent growth is 17% higher than 2021 levels, despite beginning to moderate in September, according to Rent. In other words: Rental prices could be cooling off, but the official CPI data doesn’t reflect this. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, introduced a federal bill last October that would strip large investors from snatching up single-family homes for tax incentives. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}. If that trend continues, then rent prices might fall in line with real-time inflationary measures. But if BlackRock isn’t totally responsible for stubbornly high rent prices, and neither are Airbnb hosts who drill through tasteful architectural details to hang driftwood signs that read “I’M ON LAKE TIME”... ), one other theory has gained steam in the last few years: Investment firms are scooping up homes and constricting supply. But in 2010, as credit and mortgage markets tightened following the pop of the 2008 housing bubble, more than 75% of growth in the market came from renters with incomes of $75,000 or more, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. For example, month over month rent growth was 0.5% in March, an improvement from the approximately 0.8% monthly increase we saw in late 2022. Since the pandemic began, housing prices have soared. In the March consumer price index report, rents jumped almost 9% from last year, far outpacing the overall inflation rate of 5%. Some point to spiking mortgage rates driving would-be homeowners into the rental market; others to investment firms scooping up units and limiting the available supply. When asked why renters can’t find a studio under two grand, housing experts and economists often point to one thing: not enough supply.</description>

Consumer giants Kimberly-Clark, Nestlé, and P&amp;G raked in more revenue last quarter after they jacked up prices by about 10%. —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!

Looking ahead…execs at companies like Coca-Cola say it’s only a matter of time before they’ll have to stop increasing prices or risk losing customers. Chipotle increased prices and store traffic also increased, the company said.

Because the brief, unsigned order came in response to an emergency petition, making it part of the court’s so-called shadow docket, where decisions get made quickly and without the benefit of oral arguments. But with the case all but guaranteed to end up back at the high court for a final say eventually, it does not tell us much about what the justices will ultimately decide when it gets there. And it’s going to rage: The matter reached the Supreme Court after a federal judge in Texas yanked the FDA’s approval of the drug. —AR What comes next? Why not? The government quickly appealed to the conservative-leaning US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which rejected parts of the judge’s decision but still imposed restrictions on the medicine’s availability. Meanwhile, the same day the Texas ruling came out, a Washington federal judge ordered the FDA not to restrict access to the pill in 17 states. The case is scheduled to pick back up with oral arguments at the 5th Circuit on May 17. The Supreme Court’s decision means the status quo will be maintained while that all gets sorted out.</description>

Zoom out: The UN says that India’s population could start declining in 2047. It’s due to surpass China as the most populous country on the planet this year, according to a UN report released this week. The India “buy” caseIndia has a lot going for it, including a massive labor force. India has already eclipsed its former colonizer, the United Kingdom, as the world’s fifth-largest economy, and it’s projected to nick Germany’s No. 4 spot by 2025, according to the Wall Street Journal. What’s holding India back? —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There are 900 million(! But India also has plenty of homegrown success stories. India’s domination of the global economy is far from guaranteed. India better put on some shades or risk being blinded by the spotlight. And word on the pundit street is that it’s poised to get bigger in another way—by rivaling China and the US as a major economic superpower. It’s paying off: Companies looking to diversify their supply chains away from China have embraced India as an alternative manufacturing hub. And that number is increasing—unlike in most major economies, where an aging population is sapping economic growth. Let’s explore why India’s future looks bright, and some of the obstacles on its path to international economic stardom. Apple recently began assembling its new iPhone in the country, and Volvo signaled it might start building EVs there. Nobel Prize-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee thinks India should look inward before it projects its economic ambitions abroad.</description>
