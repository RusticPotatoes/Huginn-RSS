Now it's projecting 230–260 million by 2024, which would mean surpassing Netflix.</description>

  <title>Cathie Wood and Ark Innovation Are Off to a Tough Start in 2021</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4338%2Fsinking_ark.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Ark's five exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have all dropped over 20% since early February, and its flagship fund, Ark Innovation, has declined for three weeks in a row. One example: Tesla accounts for around 10% of Ark Innovation. And Ark is particularly sensitive to any moves away from higher-risk tech stocks because it has so much exposure to them.  In 2020, Ark Innovation became the largest actively managed ETF in the world, with $17 billion in assets under management. That position made Wood look like a genius when Tesla gained almost 8x last year, but stocks don't always go up.</description>

  <title>Cathie Wood and Ark Innovation Are Off to a Tough Start in 2021</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4338%2Fsinking_ark.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But after another brutal day yesterday when Ark Innovation dropped nearly 6%, overall sentiment toward Ark may be shifting—short interest in Ark Innovation rose to its highest level ever last Thursday. One example: Tesla accounts for around 10% of Ark Innovation. And Ark is particularly sensitive to any moves away from higher-risk tech stocks because it has so much exposure to them.  Ark's five exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have all dropped over 20% since early February, and its flagship fund, Ark Innovation, has declined for three weeks in a row.</description>

  <title>Senate Passes $1.9 Trillion Stimulus Bill</title>

For the second straight March, the Senate passed an enormous bill aimed at providing relief to Americans suffering financially from the coronavirus pandemic.  Bottom line: Workers and families will have received $2.2 trillion from all of the coronavirus stimulus measures, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.</description>

  <title>How to File Your Taxes as an S-corp</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4259%2Fwoman_at_computer.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Here’s an example: Let’s say you’re a shareholder of an S-corp called Debi’s Awesome Snacks.    Taxes for S-corps and C-corps are due on March 15 so that shareholders have the info they need to file individual income taxes before April 15. which spits out a K-1 and is filed with each owner’s personal income taxes (this is how income tax transfers from business to owner). An S-corp is not as well known but offers a key advantage for qualifying LLCs and C-corps: Income taxes are passed through to the shareholders’ tax returns. We’ve gone over how to file your taxes as a sole proprietor and a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC), two very common ways to incorporate a business. So let us be clear: Attempting to DIY your taxes as an S-corp is like skiing up the mountain instead of taking a lift.</description>

  <title>Biden Prepares to Eliminate $10,000 in Student Loans</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F979%2Fcollege_campus.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This year, President Biden is expected to tackle the mounting student loan crisis with a powerful weapon: forgiveness. Forgive $10,000, which would clear balances for a third of borrowers and put a nice dent into outstanding balances for the largest group of borrowers, who hold between $20k–$40k. About 45 million Americans have outstanding student loans. Many may never have completed their degrees. The government could also expand loan forgiveness programs or enroll more borrowers in income-based repayment plans. But not everyone, even within his own party, agrees on how much he should forgive—or whether he should at all. Critics of student loan forgiveness argue that it benefits an already privileged class (college grads) and doesn’t address the root problem of expensive tuition. The state of student debt There’s a lot of it.  Biden’s optionsDo nothing. A generous gift...</description>
