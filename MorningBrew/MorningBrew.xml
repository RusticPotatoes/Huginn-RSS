  <title>The Summer Movie Season Kicks Off</title>

At least that’s what the movie theater industry is hoping. Last summer, theaters grossed $176 million, a 96% decrease from 2019.</description>

Cook also argued that Apple does not closely track the App Store’s profit and loss; in other words, the company’s bean-counting doesn’t interfere with the App Store’s integrity as a marketplace for users to discover apps.</description>

  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5081%2Fblack_wall_street_main_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Nia Clark’s Dreams of Black Wall Street series offers a deep dive into the riots, but also reflects on the massacre’s legacy, including Greenwood’s continued economic struggles, racial tensions, and the unsolved mystery of where the bodies are buried. It runs through everything from national and local factors that precipitated the event to the massacre itself to the aftermath. Go deeper on what happened May 31 and June 1Read: In 1921, journalist Walter White, who would later become the NAACP director, was sent to Tulsa to write about what happened for The Nation.  ABC’s Soul of a Nation shares the stories of survivors and looks at how the city is still working to heal those wounds.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: Recruiting Takeover </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you apply and are asked about your current company/role, my suggestion would be to reference notable companies, brands, or clients you work with along with the less-recognizable name of the smaller company you work for. is a question I get asked in every interview.  You can always check the Glassdoor profile of a company you’re applying to, but take it with a grain of salt since reviews on there can sometimes be really old. Everyone says working for a small company/startup leads to valuable skills, but many recruiters may not recognize the company's name.</description>

  <title>How to Not Get (Totally) Ripped Off When Ordering Wine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5174%2Fwine_glass.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They analyzed the prices of 6,335 wines at 249 London restaurants to understand how wine markups at restaurants really work. And for the rest of us who order the average-priced wine of the list... Much has been said about the pitfalls of ordering the second-cheapest bottle of wine on a menu.  What they found: People who order the second-cheapest bottle of wine are in fact not being ripped off more than anyone else. The wines in the middle of the menu, the Pittsburgh Pirates of the wine world, have the highest percentage markup. You pick up the wine men—er, scan the QR code to pull up the wine list.   So how are wine menus priced?</description>

Aparicio Giddins is the president and chief technology officer of Greenwood Financial, a new banking platform for Black and Latino customers. What new ways of doing things will you keep from this past year? I want to make sure that I continue getting outdoors because it really is beautiful out there.

  <title>In finance, 'people of color are shut out before they ever get in'</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5144%2Fblack_businesswoman.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There just aren't that many people of color in finance, even in New York City. Now we in finance are starting to pay attention to diversity. There are more of us now—maybe because banks realized sitting in a room with only 15 white men was a bad look. People of color are shut out before they ever get in. Do I talk to the seven people of color who work in finance? It's just you, the only woman on the floor and one of the few people of color on the floor. When Wells Fargo's CEO says he can't find qualified people of color when I personally have them reaching out to me on LinkedIn every day? I had friends of color from college who happened to be in the finance industry In speaking to my friends of color in different parts of the finance industry, our experiences were analogous. I think the finance industry wants to change. Maybe there aren't seven Black people anymore, but eight. You feel like you work harder than your coworkers with no recognition." I had a friend of color in my cohort and we were among the only people who got the job based on our interviews and credentials, and not who our family was, or who knew someone. We're hardly giving those same chances to people of color. Just to get me in the stadium, essentially. It's so hard to get your foot in the door. You're not seeing the fruits of your labor. In 2015 I received a new manager who happened to be a white man. Sure, there were one or two other Black men, but trying to fit into the culture—the culture of white people, to be frank—was difficult. There was one woman at my bank, more senior, who I could talk to as a kind of mentor. You can see the change particularly when there are industry happy hours and events. But it can be a hard few months or years. I don't know. I'm sure my story is not unique for people of color in finance.</description>
