While Summers called the corporate price gouging narrative “preposterous,” he also said it’s reasonable to raise taxes as a means of tamping down demand and inflation.

But states including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Alabama, and Arkansas will likely see their fire risks grow more than 200% in the next 30 years. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeMost homeowners can expect their wildfire risks to double over the next three decades due to climate change, according to a new report from the nonprofit First Street Foundation. A quick summary of the findings:80 million homes have some level of wildfire risk in the next 30 years, and at least 10 million homes fall between the “major” or “extreme” risk categories. —MM css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! You can view your home’s risk score here or on listing sites like realtor. Just yesterday, the New Mexico Calf Canyon Fire became the largest in state history after burning 298,060 acres. By 2052, 50% of US counties that will see fire risk jump the most are in Georgia. The report included a first-of-its-kind tool to measure wildfire risk on individual properties, accounting for factors such as a home’s roof type or the vegetation near the house.</description>

  <title>‘Succession’ actor’s protest highlights the vegan upcharge</title>

Across the industry, the retail price of nondairy, plant-based milk is around twice the price of dairy milk, according to Mintec, which analyzes food commodity costs. But while those factors may help explain why plant-based milks are expensive, they don’t fully spell out why dairy milk is so cheap. While most people probably aren’t concerned about what the human star of Babe: Pig in the City sticks himself to, Cromwell’s glue-in highlights a reality for vegans and those with dairy allergies: Things tend to cost a lot more. The lactose intolerance taxIn January, Starbucks stores in the UK made all dairy alternatives free. But in the US, Starbucks locations typically charge an additional 70 cents for nondairy options. And it’s not just Starbucks charging a premium, either. So what’s keeping those oat milk prices high? —MK Zoom out: While around 36% of Americans are lactose intolerant (a condition that predominantly affects people of color), the US is still living in its Got Milk? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There’s a higher demand for dairy milk—61% of US households primarily drink it, compared to the 23% that opt for plant-based—so production costs are more spread out and retail prices are cheaper. Given that the carbon footprint of cow milk is about 3x that of alternatives like oat milk, environmental advocates like Cromwell are hoping that removing cost burdens will lead to more people giving nondairy options a chance.</description>

Louis Rosenberg, the CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI, founded two early augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) companies and developed the first functional AR system for the Air Force in the 90s. You’ve been studying AR and VR technology since the ’90s. They currently track people and use the information to profile people and sell targeted advertising. The metaverse is going to take us from a world where Big Tech platforms, which are currently tracking where you click, track everything about your life. And I might not realize that those are virtual product placements injected into my world on behalf of a paying advertiser.</description>

We chatted with Rosenberg about the early days of VR and AR tech and what the heck the metaverse will actually look like. Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. Louis Rosenberg, the CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI, founded two early augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) companies and developed the first functional AR system for the Air Force in the 90s. You’ve been studying AR and VR technology since the ’90s. They currently track people and use the information to profile people and sell targeted advertising. The metaverse is going to take us from a world where Big Tech platforms, which are currently tracking where you click, track everything about your life. And I might not realize that those are virtual product placements injected into my world on behalf of a paying advertiser.</description>

In fact, courts in Delaware (where Twitter and many other companies are incorporated) have only ever identified one MAE, in 2018. Maybe, considering a) yesterday was Friday the 13th b) Musk later said he was “still committed to acquisition” and c) Musk has a history of trolling Wall Street regulators like they’re Dexter and he’s Dee Dee. He may not be blowing up any labs, but yesterday’s tweet caused Twitter stock to temporarily fall over 25%, which might constitute securities fraud since it directly impacted the market cap of a company he’s planning to purchase. The securities filing for the merger says that less than 5% of users are bots, and it contains a provision that Musk can walk away if that’s incorrect…but only if that bot problem has what’s known as a material adverse effect (MAE) on Twitter’s business.

Across the industry, the retail price of nondairy, plant-based milk is around twice the price of dairy milk, according to Mintec, which analyzes food commodity costs. But while those factors may help explain why plant-based milks are expensive, they don’t fully spell out why dairy milk is so cheap. While most people probably aren’t concerned about what the human star of Babe: Pig in the City sticks himself to, Cromwell’s glue-in highlights a reality for vegans and those with dairy allergies: Things tend to cost a lot more. The lactose intolerance taxIn January, Starbucks stores in the UK made all dairy alternatives free. But in the US, Starbucks locations typically charge an additional 70 cents for nondairy options. And it’s not just Starbucks charging a premium, either. So what’s keeping those oat milk prices high? —MK Zoom out: While around 36% of Americans are lactose intolerant (a condition that predominantly affects people of color), the US is still living in its Got Milk? css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! There’s a higher demand for dairy milk—61% of US households primarily drink it, compared to the 23% that opt for plant-based—so production costs are more spread out and retail prices are cheaper. Given that the carbon footprint of cow milk is about 3x that of alternatives like oat milk, environmental advocates like Cromwell are hoping that removing cost burdens will lead to more people giving nondairy options a chance.</description>

The North American Meat Institute said the report “cherry picks data to support a narrative that is completely unrepresentative of the early days of an unprecedented national emergency.” Well, a new House subcommittee report concluded that meatpacking companies exaggerated product shortages during the height of the pandemic to keep plants open and skirt Covid health guidelines.

The North American Meat Institute said the report “cherry picks data to support a narrative that is completely unrepresentative of the early days of an unprecedented national emergency.” Well, a new House subcommittee report concluded that meatpacking companies  exaggerated product shortages during the height of the pandemic to keep plants open and skirt Covid health guidelines. According to the report, Tyson even drafted the executive order issued by former President Trump in April 2020 to keep plants open.</description>

  <title>Crypto-backed mortgages let HODLers become homeowners</title>

In order for crypto mortgages to be widely adopted, he said, “a lot of users need to have digital assets that have significantly appreciated in value.” css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeRupena declined to share the exact number of crypto mortgages that Milo has executed, but he said the company has already issued over $10 million worth of loans in crypto mortgages. Though the industry is growing, it’s not for the average crypto HODLer.Ledn, Figure, and Milo all allow customers to take out mortgages by putting up cryptocurrency as collateral without cashing it out, unlike a standard mortgage where a new homeowner has the pleasure of handing over their down payment in cash on closing. Crypto mortgage companies let customers hold onto their digital currencies for a couple of reasons: First, crypto believers don’t want to liquidate their portfolio and transfer it back to dollars, just in case the price of crypto continues to rise and they miss post-liquidation gains. Rupena said that’s “incredibly encouraging,” since he’s looking for customers who want to use crypto to buy their home without selling their digital assets (and paying the subsequent taxes). Though this threat of margin calls and freefalling crypto values may be anxiety-inducing, Milo CEO Josip Rupena argues that “overall, it’s a safer mortgage transaction” than some traditional mortgages, since homeowners can liquidate their crypto before going into foreclosure.</description>

  <title>Atlanta rapper Young Thug’s own lyrics could be used against him in RICO charge</title>

Georgia prosecutors allege that Williams is one of the organizers of the Atlanta gang Young Slime Life (YSL), which has been accused of a number of violent crimes, including a 2015 murder. Williams’s lawyer told the LA Times the claims were “frivolous” and that they will “fight it and litigate it ethically, and lawfully and zealously.” —MM The law allows the state to find multiple parties guilty if it can prove that everyone in the organization committed two or more serious crimes that were part of a larger racketeering plan. In the indictment, prosecutors named nine songs that they claim are evidence of Williams’s criminal activity. Behind the charges is a 1970s statute created to take down mobsters, known as the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Prosecutors are using the state’s RICO law to charge Williams and his associates—including rappers Yak Gotti, Gunna, and Williams’s brother Unfoonk—with crimes they may not have committed, but were involved in vis-a-vis YSL.</description>

A few hours before Politico published the draft opinion, Amazon did announce it would reimburse employees for some abortion-related travel if they are on Amazon’s health insurance.</description>
