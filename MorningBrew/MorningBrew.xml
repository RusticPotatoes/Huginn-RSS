If confirmed, Yellen will become the first woman to lead the Treasury Department.   What else will be on her agenda? President-elect Joe Biden is expected to nominate the former Fed Chair as the next Treasury secretary, as first reported by the WSJ.   Of course, Yellen's first couple months will be preoccupied with one objective: putting this coronavirus-induced recession in the rearview. Biden said his Treasury secretary pick would please those across the political spectrum, and Yellen is it.</description>

  <title>Pfizer Applies for Emergency Use Authorization</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3074/vaccine.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  With vaccines, “emergency” is relative. If that’s approved, about 20 million Americans—likely healthcare workers and the elderly—could be immunized before the end of the year. Moderna, which reported a 94.5% effective vaccine, will be next to file an application.</description>

  <title>Steve Mnuchin Defends Pulling of Fed Emergency Lending Funds</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/3189/treasury_secretary_mnuchi.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It’s the rivalry no one asked for but we got because everything else is canceled.   Mnuchin: Nobody panic Mnuchin tried to calm down investors by doing an interview with someone who’s known for calming down investors: Jim Cramer. He said he’s made his pick, one who will be accepted by “all elements of the Democratic Party.” and there’s plenty of money available, should it be needed. But Thursday’s surprise announcement was one of the few times that politics may have weaseled into their relationship.</description>

  <title>2020 U.S. Consumer Habits Mystify Finance Biz</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/2WdOfxEu9ZcnWajI30/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Consumer loan bonds outpaced junk bonds, corporate loans, and mortgage-backed securities .   You’d be wrong  U.S. consumers are in fine form—by some measures. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, consumer lending firms suffered losses of 60%–70%, according to consumer lending firm OneMain’s chief risk officer. This year has not been an easy one to be a business writer—though I’m lucky to have remained employed and many people’s jobs are way more challenging than mine.     So...   How do we know that? Those are a class of “asset-backed securities,” or financial instruments that bet on an asset, like a consumer loan, yielding a return. Plus, in the quarantine era, there just isn’t as much to spend money on. what does it all mean? big time.</description>
