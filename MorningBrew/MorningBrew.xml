  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6366%2Fvaccine_approval.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When it received full approval in the UK, Moderna chose “Spikevax,” which goes harder than a packed basement show. Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine received full approval from the FDA yesterday, becoming the first US-made vaccine to move beyond emergency use authorization.</description>

  <title>How a Blockchain Expert Fights Crypto Crime</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6353%2Fkimberly_grauer_of_chainalysis.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Earlier this month, hackers nabbed over $600 million in crypto from decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Poly Network in one of the biggest crypto heists ever. It wasn't invented by cryptocurrency people. There was I think almost 400% growth in ransomware attacks, 350% growth, and this year is on track to outpace last year already. I think that's one thing that’s going to play out over the next year. Each type of crime is very, very different. I was reading the SEC’s red flags for investors and almost every single one of them applies to cryptocurrency. The victims of ransomware attacks are mostly businesses; increasingly, we're seeing that the victims of ransomware are big businesses, where you might have a more sophisticated attack vector so you can ask for more money. If you send ransom to a wallet, you actually have a shot at getting it back because we can follow where the money goes. We're able to let people know if they're accepting money from a darknet marketplace. And the theory is that they actually fake their own death in order to run away with the stolen funds. And then I learned while I was doing some research on this case that there's this whole faking-your-death industry in cryptocurrency. Has any type of illicit cryptocurrency activity noticeably grown in the past year? Do you have any predictions for the landscape of illicit cryptocurrency activity? Like, the Ponzi scheme actually works in almost exactly the same way.  If you can't find information about who the people really are and there's no incorporation info, who would you be able to go to if you weren't able to access your funds?   Ransomware is something that the government is extremely interested in right now. But the benefit of cryptocurrency is that there's a recourse to these attacks. And then we have a bunch of other ransomware hacks or stolen funds, sanctioned addresses, terrorist financing, and fraud shops (a type of darknet marketplace that only sells illicit goods). An exchange was hacked, but then it was speculated that the person actually faked their own death. We found this drug smuggling group based out of Australia who were importing drugs from the UK, and what they would do was purchase really fancy furniture from Harrods.</description>

The FDA could grant full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine as soon as today, according to the NYT.  More manufacturing scrutiny: Full approval requires more inspections of facilities and vaccine makers to provide more detailed production info, per Marks.</description>

So, this is the first time social media platforms have had to take a stance on whether to allow the Taliban in its resumed role as effective leader of Afghanistan to post content.</description>

So, this is the first time social media platforms have had to take a stance on whether to allow the Taliban in its resumed role as effective leader of Afghanistan to post content.</description>

  <title>Make It Work: How to Ask for the Raise You Deserve</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Not only is it reasonable—and decidedly not insensitive, greedy, or insulting—to ask that your employer consider the fair value of your contributions, but most managers would prefer a little candor now over an unexpected resignation later from an employee they may never have known was feeling undervalued. While it’s fine to acknowledge that times are hard, there will always be a reason for your employer not to show you the money (don’t recommend this approach, btw).   Instead, focus on the great things you are doing to add value and the measurable outcomes of your work (especially those that underpin key financial metrics) by tying your deliverables to the goals and objectives of the business wherever possible.</description>

  <title>The Great Havana Syndrome Mystery</title>

In the years since, reported Havana syndrome cases among US foreign officers have popped up in Moscow, China, London, Virginia, and, most recently, Vienna and Germany.  One recent victim, who was working at a US embassy in Europe, told the WSJ it was “striking” that some people hit with the attacks were working on Russia-related issues.  Turns out, they were suffering from an illness experienced by dozens of US diplomats and intelligence officers around the globe in recent years: Havana Syndrome.</description>

  <title>Icebreakers With...E-Commerce Mogul Marc Lore</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.morningbrew.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F6328%2Fmarc_lore.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; What is a fact that most people don’t know about you? When you have an idea for a business there always seems to be concern about telling too many people out of fear that someone will steal it. It doesn’t work like that.  What will be the most disruptive force in e-commerce in the next 10 years? Land appreciation is caused by primarily two things: First is when people build communities, other people want to join those communities and live in those locations. Share your idea with as many people as possible.  In the future buying something will be like having your own personal Jarvis. Sharing ideas with as many people as possible will help you shape your vision, plus it will help you recruit people. Having a really strong Chief People Officer can help set the culture and values and bring in the very best, most diverse talent. And now in the startups that I’m creating today, the Chief People Officer is typically the first hire, because people are the most important asset within a company. People will tell you it doesn’t make sense and why it won’t work. And it’s about being more equitable and giving citizens an ownership stake and, as the city does better, the residents do better. That was fun and interesting, but more interesting was that they were going to take the fastest time of the week and send the person to the US national team training camp.   It seems to me that the fair way to do it would be for all this land appreciation—appreciation caused by the people within the city—to benefit those citizens and come back to them. At the end of the month there were tryouts and the top 13 would make the US national team.</description>

Crypto is getting hotter and hotterThe current market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has soared to about $2 trillion¹; bitcoin alone is at around $850 billion.  Bottom line: Crypto is no longer niche. These trends help show that investors think crypto is a good place to park their money, even if governments are just making moves to regulate it now. is basically just the world these days. ²In April, crypto exchange Coinbase went public at a valuation of about $85 billion, showing there’s quite a bit of appetite for access to cryptos. You can also pay with bitcoin when you order the latest paperback plus some dish soap on Amazon. The water’s warm, and with Bakkt, you can swan-dive in, free of transaction fees and with as little as $10. But because of fractional coins and investment tools like futures and ETFs, you can invest as little as $5 in cryptocurrency.</description>
