  <title>NFTs, Bitcoin, SPACs, Snakers: Too Many Crazes to Count</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F1241%2Fmr_krabs.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   A short listCrypto: Last March, bitcoin was hovering just above $5,000; on Saturday, it hit an all-time high of above $61,000. The amount wagered on SPACs to fall in value has tripled since the start of the year, per the WSJ. Zoom out: No one knows exactly if/when any of these "mini-bubbles'' will pop but, at least in the SPAC world, some think it might be soon. Even NFTs were being developed as early as 2017. SPACs have been around for decades, sneaker-flipping dates back to 1985, and trading cards, well…you get the point. Plus, it’s not like any of the "crazes" described above are that new.</description>

  <title>How a Former NBA Player Turned Entrepreneur Does His Taxes </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4359%2Fpaul_shirley.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt; MB: OK so one more question about basketball.  One thing I learned along the way is that I don’t like to write alone.  PB: Yes, it’s called Ball Boy and it’s about a kid named Gray whose mother moves him from LA to Beaudelaire, Kansas.  PS: Luckily, no, but there was one time when someone broke in and stole all of our wallets.  MB: Don’t pro athletes have to deal with a lot of state taxes too? So I had to stash the money in my shoes and hope that no one would take it while we were playing.  MB: How did you pay yourself at Writers Blok, and now with The Process? It’s something that mostly affects actors and athletes, but they aren’t going to complain and no one really feels bad for them. And he was like that with everyone.  PS: So, we established it as a 501(c)3 nonprofit, which ended up being a bad idea because it’s hard to get loans if you’re a nonprofit. How did you go about organizing your finances back then?  MB: Tell us a little bit about that.  PS: One time I tried to do them myself on TurboTax. I messed it up so badly that my accountant had to write a letter to the IRS and say, if you help us fix this, Paul promises to never, ever do his taxes on his own again. From 2001–2002 I played with the Panionios Athens in Greece, and one nice thing was they covered the taxes in their country.  PS: When I was in the NBA, I always thought I’d write a book afterward.  MB: You also have a new book out now, right? Now we have a long history of working together and he understands my background as well as where I want to go in the future.  MB: So how do you work through that? Do you remember how you did your taxes back then?  PS: At Writers Blok I paid myself as a contractor, so I had a 1099. So we started organizing it a bit better, providing wine and cream pies, and then it grew into Writers Blok, which I like to describe as a yoga studio but for writing. I found someone after about a year of playing basketball professionally, and he’s still the person I work with today. What was it like to play with the greats?</description>
