  <title>China's Communist Party Turns 100</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5622%2Fchina_ceremony.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the liberalization of China’s economy, the country has developed a close business relationship with the West—just last week Nike’s CEO said, “Nike is a brand that is of China and for China.”  After the Communists gained power in the 1949 revolution, Mao initiated a series of disastrous economic reforms that led to the deaths of tens of millions of people. Bottom line: At 100 years old, the Communist Party remains a potent global force led by a president who could be the first since Mao to rule until he dies. Its caginess around the origins of Covid-19 has made things worse.</description>

  <title>The Top Five Business Stories of Q2</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5600%2Fimage_of_a_scoreboard_showing_end_of_q2.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Inflation scaries With prices increasing at rates not seen in years, the No. 1 business story of the quarter could only be inflation. The number of companies citing inflation in their earnings calls hit a 10-year high, Chipotle hiked its menu prices, and at one point in April the cheapest rental car on Maui was a Toyota Camry that cost $722 a day. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has argued higher inflation is mostly transitory, while legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones responded, “that one just doesn’t work the way I see the world.” More Americans quit in May than any month on record. Yet lingering health concerns, childcare responsibilities, and generous unemployment payments have kept Americans from returning to the labor force. With the economy reawakening faster than expected, employers are desperate to hire employees to meet demand. Help wanted9.3 million. 2. For example, in Mississippi less than a third of the population is fully vaccinated.</description>

  <title>SpaceX’s Starlink Internet Service Has 69,420 Users</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/fr0a9Np0PlcJTVevU5/giphy.gif'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Musk said Starlink could make up to $30 billion in revenue per year—about 10 times the revenue of the rocket-launching side of SpaceX. Starlink provides internet via a network of over 1,500 satellites orbiting low enough for stargazers to spot them overhead.    But like cheap printers with expensive ink, Starlink hopes to recoup initial costs later on. 69,420, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said yesterday.</description>

  <title>US Home Price Growth Hits a Record High in April</title>

Home prices in cities like Phoenix, San Diego, and Seattle are all up more than 20% year over year. “People are kind of burnt out.” Sounds pretty bubbly, right? Another buyer in Austin, TX, bought two houses from the same seller so he could get the one he really wanted.</description>

  <title>United Makes Big Bet on the Future of Air Travel</title>

Fast forward to yesterday, and United Airlines just placed its largest plane order ever and the biggest of any airline in a decade. One does not simply order 270 state-of-the-art planes worth more than $30 billion and then leave them unused in the hangar.</description>

The first US company to hit a $1 trillion valuation was Apple in 2018, and since then Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet have all joined.</description>

  <title>Juul Agrees to Pay $40 million to Settle North Carolina Vaping Case</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5592%2Fjuul.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When Altria, the tobacco giant that owns Marlboro, bought a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, Juul was valued at $38 billion. The same year, the FDA called teen vaping an “epidemic” and started to crack down on Juul and other e-cig companies. Although Juul insisted that its products were intended for adults, its marketing strategies said otherwise... as of last summer, Juul was facing 758 lawsuits across the US. Juul released fruit-flavored pods that went viral among teens (it's pulled most flavors since). That verdict is expected by September.</description>

The same year, the FDA called teen vaping an “epidemic” and started to crack down on Juul and other e-cig companies. When Altria, the tobacco giant that owns Marlboro, bought a 35% stake in Juul in 2018, Juul was valued at $38 billion. The value of Juul plummeted to $4.5 billion. Juul invented fruit flavored e-cigarette pods that went viral among teens. as of July 22, 2020, Juul was facing 758 lawsuits across the US.</description>

  <title>Extra Unemployment Benefits Are Drying Up </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5571%2Fus-unemployment-job.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Businesses are desperate to hire workers, and many states think scrapping the extra $300/week in unemployment benefits, which the Biden administration incorporated into its pandemic relief bill, will spur more job-seeking.  In the states that cut off the extra payments the earliest, the number of workers who were paid benefits decreased 13.8% from mid-May to mid-June. On Capitol Hill last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that extra benefits could be playing a role in the worker shortage problem, but focused his attention on other challenges holding back the job market.</description>
