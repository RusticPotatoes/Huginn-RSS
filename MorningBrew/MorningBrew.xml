One approach would be to invoke a clause in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which affirms the sanctity of public debt, so the Federal government can keep borrowing in order to continue paying its existing creditors. Last month, the GOP-controlled House passed a bill that would lift the borrowing cap and slash government spending by around $3.2 trillion over 10 years. Republicans in Congress say they won’t increase the debt limit without budget cuts. css-y2oq5g{display:-webkit-inline-box;display:-webkit-inline-flex;display:-ms-inline-flexbox;display:inline-flex;-webkit-appearance:none;-moz-appearance:none;-ms-appearance:none;appearance:none;-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify-content:center;-webkit-user-select:none;-moz-user-select:none;-ms-user-select:none;user-select:none;position:relative;white-space:nowrap;vertical-align:middle;outline:2px solid transparent;outline-offset:2px;width:auto;line-height:1.2;border-radius:var(--chakra-radii-md);font-weight:var(--chakra-fontWeights-semibold);transition-property:var(--chakra-transition-property-common);transition-duration:var(--chakra-transition-duration-normal);height:var(--chakra-sizes-10);min-width:var(--chakra-sizes-10);font-size:var(--chakra-fontSizes-md);-webkit-padding-start:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-start:var(--chakra-space-4);-webkit-padding-end:var(--chakra-space-4);padding-inline-end:var(--chakra-space-4);color:var(--chakra-colors-white);background:var(--colors-primary);radius:var(--border-radius);}.

  <title>Britain’s economy rains on Charles’s parade</title>

Become smarter in just 5 minutesGet the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable. One anti-monarchy group, Republic, is using the coronation as an opportunity to protest. What’s going down: The coronation, which celebrates King Charles III’s ascent to the throne, will start with a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. The BBC will provide coverage all day, but for Brits who aren’t tempted by the crown jewels, rival Channel 4 will offer a variety of their own programming, including comedian Frankie Boyle’s documentary Farewell to the Monarchy. —CC Most of the royal family’s wealth can be attributed to vast real estate portfolios, such as the Duchy of Cornwall, the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Crown Estate, which account for nearly 500,000 acres of land. There, Charles will be anointed as the head of the Church of England, presented with a scepter and an orb, and given a crown worth $57 million to wear for a hot second before he ascends the literal throne in front of 2,200 guests (not including Meghan Markle). King Charles’s net worth is the subject of much intrigue and is estimated to be between $750 million and $1.4 billion. Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation cost £1.57 million in 1953—or more than $70 million in today’s dollars. With 1.2 million people expected to party it up in London, celebrations for the coronation—think pubs open all day long, hotels booked up, and cardboard cutouts of Charles and Camilla—will bring in an extra $437 million, UKHospitality estimates. As for the coronation itself, programming starts at 5am ET on several TV channels in the US.</description>

  <title>Britain’s economy rains on Charles’s parade</title>

What’s going down: The coronation, which celebrates King Charles III’s ascent to the throne, will start with a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. The BBC will provide coverage all day, but for Brits who aren’t tempted by the crown jewels, rival Channel 4 will offer a variety of their own programming, including comedian Frankie Boyle’s documentary Farewell to the Monarchy. —CC Most of the royal family’s wealth can be attributed to vast real estate portfolios, such as the Duchy of Cornwall, the Duchy of Lancaster, and the Crown Estate, which account for nearly 500,000 acres of land. There, Charles will be anointed as the head of the Church of England, presented with a scepter and an orb, and given a crown worth $57 million to wear for a hot second before he ascends the literal throne in front of 2,200 guests (not including Meghan Markle). King Charles’s net worth is the subject of much intrigue and is estimated to be between $750 million and $1.4 billion. Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation cost £1.57 million in 1953—or more than $70 million in today’s dollars. With 1.2 million people expected to party it up in London, celebrations for the coronation—think pubs open all day long, hotels booked up, and cardboard cutouts of Charles and Camilla—will bring in an extra $437 million, UKHospitality estimates. As for the coronation itself, programming starts at 5am ET on several TV channels in the US.</description>

  <title>New York nixes gas stoves in new buildings</title>

On Tuesday, the state became the first to ban natural gas in new buildings as part of a slide toward electric power. Some cities—San Francisco, New York City, and Seattle—have passed their own natural gas bans. The ban—slated to go into effect starting in 2026—would apply to all natural gas facilities in new residential buildings and some commercial ones (restaurants, hospitals, and, um, crematoriums are exempt). —CC css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! The ban will help New York meet its strict greenhouse gas emissions goals. A partisan debate ignited, and it’s still burning:Republican lawmakers oppose any ban, citing energy cost increases, while many Democrats support a ban to curb climate change. But 20 Republican-controlled state legislatures have preemptively enacted laws that prohibit cities from banning natural gas. Though the problem has been known for years, the issue came off the back burner in January when a US Consumer Product Safety Commission official publicly floated a national ban. css-1dlcpt7[data-disabled]{opacity:0.4;background-color:rgba(0,0,0,. Natural gas comes with adverse health effects, according to the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, as well as detrimental environmental impacts.</description>

  <title>Rate Hike: Episode X - A New Hope</title>

While eager investors always read a lot into any small update, this time even Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged it was a “meaningful change” when asked about it at a press conference. The tweak removed a line included in other recent statements that said the Fed “anticipates” additional rate increases. So, if the Fed is going to come off the rate-raising tear it’s been on since March 2022, inflation needs to keep slowing. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeThese Fed sequels are starting to feel repetitive: The Federal Reserve raised interest rates by another 25 basis points yesterday—the 10th rate hike in a little over a year. But with all the rate hikes the Fed has made already—not to mention the recent failures of three banks, which forced financial institutions to raise their lending standards—inflation is likely to keep coming down. But the hike cycle may be broken soonThe Fed hasn’t made any promises (it never does), but economists are hopeful that a revision to the Fed’s language in the statement it put out yesterday—coupled with recent slowdowns in inflation and hiring—may indicate an upcoming pause in rate hikes. The hike puts interest rates above 5% for the first time since 2007, as stubborn inflation has prompted the Fed’s fastest series of rate increases since the 1980s. —ML</description>

  <title>VC funding dropped to $18 billion last month</title>

One sector that’s on the up-and-up: AI, partly due to increased investor interest in generative AI tools like ChatGPT and Bard. Companies in the AI space are raising at high valuations, Teare said, but despite the spike, the sector wasn’t enough to buoy the rest of the tech industry’s numbers. The technologies that will shape the future of business, all in one newsletter. “Every single funding stage is down from the peaks of 2021, but I think seed funding has stayed the most robust—it’s the least impacted by what’s happening—and then…Series A is stronger than Series B,” Teare said, adding, “It’ll be interesting to see how that market—the newer companies being formed…what those valuations and what those round sizes look like into 2023.” Looking aheadAcross the board, investors seem to be choosier about their investments, and since the “heat has gone away from the market…it’s just a much more selective funding environment overall,” Teare said. Top-up roundsBut Teare said her team has seen more companies raise extension rounds—especially if they need extra money to carry them through to their next big milestone or larger-scale funding round, in a presumably less challenging funding environment. “What we’ve seen now is that, broadly, for the tech industry, that companies are not able to raise…that next big master round, and so they’re raising extensions…funding to sort of tide over that company for the next 12 to 18 months, to get them through to a funding environment which is a little bit stronger.” “Typically, you raise rounds every 18 to 24 months, and we were seeing companies raise more often…some more at 12 to 18 months…largely because they could in this funding environment,” Teare said.</description>

If you fire up Incognito Mode and head to Pornhub with an IP address in the state of Utah, you’ll be diverted to a page that has an adult performer (SFW) reading a statement from the site that claims “giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users.” Counterpoint: Social media companies warn that restricting access to their sites would limit free speech and push younger users to less safe, more-fringe corners of the internet—an argument echoed by Pornhub in its opposition to the Utah bill. —MM To protest a new age restriction law that goes into effect today, MindGeek’s adult sites, including Pornhub, blocked access to its content in Utah.</description>

Purchasing beleaguered banks has been part of its growth strategy for some time, but the bank has experienced buyer’s remorse in the past: JPMorgan had to deal with legal issues and extra expenses when it took over Bear Stearns during the 2008 financial crisis. “This part of the crisis is over,” Dimon said, reasoning that after the three recent bank collapses, there just aren’t many more financial institutions with a large share of uninsured deposits to make them vulnerable to panics. JPMorgan took over First Republic (and its affluent client list), in return for $10.6 billion paid to regulators and other financial concessions. —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none!

For now…no one knows if the credits are truly rolling on the banking crisis, but investors seemed to take Dimon’s assurances to heart: Stocks didn’t tank yesterday like they did after the bank failures in March. Purchasing beleaguered banks has been part of its growth strategy for some time, but the bank has experienced buyer’s remorse in the past: JPMorgan had to deal with legal issues and extra expenses when it took over Bear Stearns during the 2008 financial crisis. “This part of the crisis is over,” Dimon said, reasoning that after the three recent bank collapses, there just aren’t many more financial institutions with a large share of uninsured deposits to make them vulnerable to panics. JPMorgan took over First Republic (and its affluent client list), in return for $10.6 billion paid to regulators and other financial concessions. —SK css-1dlcpt7[data-readonly]{box-shadow:none! The aerobic advice came after the banking heavyweight got even bulkier by gobbling up most of the assets of failed First Republic Bank. Are more banking crises coming? But Dimon thinks this time is different, as First Republic had a simpler business model.</description>

  <title>No Shave November in May…but for lawns</title>

In past years, participants have watched their lawns transform from an “ecological dead zone”—as one professor calls the average American yard—into a tall-grassed ecosystem rife with bumblebees, songbirds, chipmunks, and other forest friends... But some environmentalists say No Mow May isn’t the right way to bring biodiversity back to residential areas because it “teases” insects and other pollinators. css-y2oq5g[data-hover][data-disabled]{background:var(--colors-primary);opacity:0.5;}SubscribeTo mow or not to mow? —ML That is the question homeowners are debating as more cities and towns embrace No Mow May, a movement started in 2019 to revitalize backyard wildlife by refraining from lawn care for an entire month. The Guelph Turfgrass Institute suggests channeling the benefits of No Mow May throughout the other 11 months by sectioning off a part of the yard as a permanent “wildflower zone.”</description>

First Republic tried to weather the storm itself, but after customers withdrew more than $100 billion in deposits in Q1 and its share price plunged nearly 75% last week alone, the government had to hang the “closed” sign on the door. But by quickly finding a buyer over the weekend, the government avoided the unsavory tactic it had to deploy for SVB: protecting deposits over the federally insured cap of $250,000. JPMorgan said it will assume First Republic’s $92 billion in deposits, which is a welcome outcome since making SVB depositors whole cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund about $20 billion. First Citizens collected the scraps of SVB, New York Community Bank snatched up assets of Signature Bank, and UBS absorbed crosstown rival Credit Suisse. Like SVB, First Republic is a midsized California-based lender with a specific client base—in this case, wealthy individuals—that made it particularly exposed to the shockwaves of the recent banking turmoil.</description>
