  <title>The Historical Performance of the Stock Market Based on Presidential Party</title>

  <title>How to Sell a Haunted House</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2991/halloween_haunted_house.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  So how do you sell a haunted house?   That seems to be the exception to rule, because haunted houses are typically not an easy sell. Both Lynnewood Hall (dubbed the world's largest haunted house) in Elkins Park, PA, and the house from The Silence of the Lambs are on the market. Depends on the state  In New York, if the seller has "claimed to the public at large" that the house is haunted, he or she must disclose the spooky status to buyers.   Believe it or not, hauntedness is a legal designation in the real estate industry.</description>

  <title>U.S. GDP Rose 7.4% on Quarterly Basis in Q3</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2971/q3_gdp.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, GDP is down 3.5% this year.   On a quarter-to-quarter basis, Q3 GDP rose 7.4%, following a 9% drop in Q2. **Annualized rate: measured as if the economy will continue growing at that pace for a full year.

  <title>How to Get Morning Brew Swag for Free</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2962/referral_cycle.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Here are 6 strategies for racking up referrals and getting free Brew swag just in time for the holidays.   To a copywriter named Rob Allen, the undisputed king of Brew referrals with well over 3,000 to his name, Quora is a nonstop referral generator. That’s because when you hit certain referral milestones, we’ll send you Morning Brew swag, like a mug or even a sweatshirt.   2. Do what this guy did   Giphy  To most people, Quora is just a popular site people visit to ask questions and find answers to every subject under the sun. But using your group chats to sign people up for the Brew can actually be a referral magnet.   You can read Rob’s blog post about his referral conquest here, but the short version goes like this: he identified a commonly asked question about the stock market, answered it intelligently, added his referral link at the bottom of his answer, then watched the referrals pour in as his post earned over 180,000 page views.   6.   5.   4.   1. Let the Brew sell itself. Do what Alex and Austin did   Sara Hillstrom The cofounders of the Brew know a thing or three about getting email signups.   And if you get in trouble...   Once people have taken the bait and interacted with the screenshot (or even if they haven’t), hit them with a follow-up text saying “Btw, if you want to sign up for the Brew, here’s the link.” Here's how:  First, send an initial text to your group, but don’t include your referral link yet.</description>

  <title>Why Europe Locked Down—Again</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2951/europe_lockdown.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The moves made the Continent’s stock markets swoon  The Stoxx 600, a pan-European index, suffered its worst one-day drop since September ahead of Macron’s announcement.   France’s neighbor Germany also enacted a partial, month-long lockdown.   Bottom line: The U.S. and Europe have resoundingly failed to hold onto the progress made over the summer against the virus.   The WHO said the European region accounted for almost half of the new Covid-19 cases reported last week. German restaurants, bars, gyms, concert halls, and theaters will close starting Nov. 2.</description>

  <title>The Perfect Investment Does Not Exist</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='https://oslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/medium/asset/2958/primary.jpg'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investing in the stock market can feel that way, too.   The market will always ebb and flow, but if you take a long term approach to investing with money you can afford to let sit and grow, the best time to start is still ASAP. Then use your time to stay informed on certain sectors, read up on quarterly earnings reports of big companies, and earmark that cash to invest the next time there’s a market downturn. The idea of perfect timing doesn’t apply to smart investing—leave that to boarding escalators and planning the perfect proposal. It’s human nature to plan for the perfect moment—be it proposing to your partner on a beach with an airplane banner, or landing the perfect step on an escalator at the mall.</description>
