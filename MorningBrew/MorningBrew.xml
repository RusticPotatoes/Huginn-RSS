  <title>Make It Work: Recruiting Takeover </title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F4689%2Fmake_it_work_logo.png&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When you apply and are asked about your current company/role, my suggestion would be to reference notable companies, brands, or clients you work with along with the less-recognizable name of the smaller company you work for. is a question I get asked in every interview.  You can always check the Glassdoor profile of a company you’re applying to, but take it with a grain of salt since reviews on there can sometimes be really old. Everyone says working for a small company/startup leads to valuable skills, but many recruiters may not recognize the company's name.</description>

  <title>How to Not Get (Totally) Ripped Off When Ordering Wine</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5174%2Fwine_glass.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They analyzed the prices of 6,335 wines at 249 London restaurants to understand how wine markups at restaurants really work. And for the rest of us who order the average-priced wine of the list... Much has been said about the pitfalls of ordering the second-cheapest bottle of wine on a menu.  What they found: People who order the second-cheapest bottle of wine are in fact not being ripped off more than anyone else. The wines in the middle of the menu, the Pittsburgh Pirates of the wine world, have the highest percentage markup. You pick up the wine men—er, scan the QR code to pull up the wine list.   So how are wine menus priced?</description>

Aparicio Giddins is the president and chief technology officer of Greenwood Financial, a new banking platform for Black and Latino customers. What new ways of doing things will you keep from this past year? I want to make sure that I continue getting outdoors because it really is beautiful out there. This interview was lightly edited and condensed for clarity. It's a shame I've been stuck in a concrete building for the last 20 years.</description>

  <title>In finance, 'people of color are shut out before they ever get in'</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5144%2Fblack_businesswoman.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There just aren't that many people of color in finance, even in New York City. Now we in finance are starting to pay attention to diversity. There are more of us now—maybe because banks realized sitting in a room with only 15 white men was a bad look. People of color are shut out before they ever get in. Do I talk to the seven people of color who work in finance? It's just you, the only woman on the floor and one of the few people of color on the floor. When Wells Fargo's CEO says he can't find qualified people of color when I personally have them reaching out to me on LinkedIn every day? I had friends of color from college who happened to be in the finance industry In speaking to my friends of color in different parts of the finance industry, our experiences were analogous. I think the finance industry wants to change. Maybe there aren't seven Black people anymore, but eight. You feel like you work harder than your coworkers with no recognition." I had a friend of color in my cohort and we were among the only people who got the job based on our interviews and credentials, and not who our family was, or who knew someone. We're hardly giving those same chances to people of color. Just to get me in the stadium, essentially. It's so hard to get your foot in the door. You're not seeing the fruits of your labor. In 2015 I received a new manager who happened to be a white man. Sure, there were one or two other Black men, but trying to fit into the culture—the culture of white people, to be frank—was difficult. There was one woman at my bank, more senior, who I could talk to as a kind of mentor. You can see the change particularly when there are industry happy hours and events. But it can be a hard few months or years. I don't know. I'm sure my story is not unique for people of color in finance.</description>

But yesterday, amid the market chaos, Musk confirmed his overall support for bitcoin with a tweet: “Tesla has 💎 🙌” On a crazy day for crypto, everyone had something to sayLet’s pass the mic...</description>

  <title>Why Banking With Greenwood Is About More Than the Money</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5135%2Fgreenwood.jpeg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In March, Greenwood raised a $40 million Series A from Truist Bank, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase, and most recently, Greenwood partnered with Mastercard to create its first debit card and other educational resources for customers. Greenwood Financial’s founders were inspired by the prosperity of the Greenwood District. Greenwood’s fully digital platform allows people to bank with them from all over the country, specifically in areas that have been shunned by traditional banks, known as bank deserts. But it’s not just about making Greenwood’s services accessible; its users have to trust it, which means reframing the fraught relationship between the US financial institutions and Black Americans. And Greenwood, we're making the Black version of that movie.” As of last June, only 0.2% of all banks regulated by the FDIC were Black-owned, and the number of Black-owned banks has been cut in half since 2001. In the early 1900s, the Greenwood District of Tusla, Oklahoma—often referred to as Black Wall Street—was home to a thriving Black business community.  “You can get Apple Pay and Google Pay, you can get a savings account, a spending account, and you can go to the ATM. The digital banking platform is designed specifically for Black and Latino customers who have historically been denied access to credit and other financial services at much higher rates than white customers. Giddins mentions Italian-American Amadeo Giannini who founded Bank of America, at the time called “Bank of Italy,” in 1904 as a way to provide loans to immigrants who were denied by major financial institutions.</description>

  <title>8 Charts that Explore Racial Disparities in the Banking Industry</title>
  <description>&lt;img src='/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Foslo-production.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Fmedium%2Fasset%2F5081%2Fblack_wall_street_main_image.jpg&amp;w=3840&amp;q=75'&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Let's break it down by genderWhile there were more than 2x the number of Black women working in financial services at the professional level than Black men in 2018, their representation at the top was lower: 1.4% of executive/senior officials are Black men compared to 1.3% of Black women. Francis Scialabba But at the tippy top, &lt;4% of the top managers identified as Black at most big banks. The presence of fewer Black banks can have an impact on local communities, the Urban Institute writes: "As technology has allowed larger banks to deepen their market penetration without the need for physical branches, physical community bank branches are often the last defense between a community and banking isolation. Francis Scialabba That lack of capital has been a big constraint on many Black banks' abilities to lend and expand. Black banks are a small piece of the pieWhile the dollar value of assets held by all MDIs increased more than 3.5x over the last two decades, the share held by Black banks has fallen to &lt;2% the total. At the end of 2020, there were just 20 Black banks. you know the drillThe average share of Black employees classified at the first/mid level at those same banks was 6.9%.  On average, Black workers accounted for 7.9% of professional workers. You can find the remaining 20 Black banks... Francis Scialabba Black banks typically practice relationship banking: a more consultative approach that involves getting to know a customer and their needs and offering a variety of products and services. Across their total employee base, four—JPMorgan, Bank of America, PNC, and Capital One—had a 13% or greater share of Black employees (similar to the population at large, in which Black Americans were last estimated at 13.4%). Black banks have a longevity and capital problem. Wall Street's not the only streetOne way the US government has tried to narrow the racial wealth gap is by supporting Black-owned banks. Wall Street has a diversity problem.</description>

This past weekend, they fell after he replied to a tweet implying that Tesla may have sold its bitcoin holdings (Musk later said Tesla didn't).
